‐Now he is leaving your network.‐To go where?Oh, to the network runby my new friend, Laurie Bream.‐You guys, there's really no other option.‐Yes, there is.If Hooli won't sell us Foxhole,we could just buy Hooli.Big question.How do we buy Hooli?You want this deal to close,you bring us the forms,get everyone's hard signatureand then bring them to me.You're not gonna turn your backon 30 yearsof making money together,are you?I don't want to be in businesswith any of you people.Everybody's gathered out there,so you should probablysay something.Won't they be happy?I freed them from Gavin.Or your companyjust swallowed theirsand you fired their founderand CEO.Richard: All wewanted was Foxhole,and instead we gotall these Hooli people.We really couldn't justfire them, sight unseen?Uh‐uh. Tracy from HRhas to do an assessmentof each person first,then we should can them.Oh, hey. I think I knowthat guy. Uh, yeah.Dinesh: What are you doing?Did you just wave him in?I‐I don't know,automatic social shit.Hey, Ethan!Uh...‐What are you doing here?‐You tell me, boss.Uh, Ethan was my firstmanager when I was at Hooli.I didn't know youstill worked there.Yeah, well, we can't allinvent middle‐out compression.Uh, anyway, I‐I hopeI make the cut.Yeah, well, we're having to becreative with the merger, so...Yeah, totally.That's why I figured I could maybe help.You could use Hooli OS foryour entire mobile suite.Yeah, we're not gonnaspend months portingHooli software overto our protocol, so...‐But thanks.‐Yeah, it was a good thought.Yeah, you wouldn't have to.When we iterated HooliOS 11, we reengineeredthe entire networklayer to be compatiblewith other protocols...and you own it.How quickly,would you say,you could, um, make itwork with PiperNet?A few weeks withalmost zero refactor.How much money do you thinkthat could save us?So you guys are planningto build your ownexternal antennas to deployfor the Hawaii test?‐Why?‐The zero‐start problem.Until we have a criticalmass of users,iOS and Android devicesdon't have enough range.Right, of course not,but push‐to‐talk HooliPhones do.Dinesh:HooliPhones?You want us to roll outour network on push‐to‐talk,- ‐janky‐ass HooliPhones?- ‐Laugh it up, but,uh, the fact thatthey still have low power,omnidirectional antennasmeans they havea radius of four miles.What is your antenna's range?‐One mile?‐Gilfoyle: Wrong.One‐point‐one‐five.Okay. Line of sight, though.‐Maybe.‐Richard,you guys just bought250,000 HooliPhones.Instead of spending more money onexpensive and mediocre antennas,why not just give awayHooliPhones for the test?Delete.Richard:You know, Ethan, could youwalk us through the Hooli OSside of all this work?Yeah, totally,but I think it'd go fasterif I just took pointand your guys backed me up.I'm sorry, what do youmean, back you up?Guys, we arein a huge hole here.Whatever it takesto get us out of it, please.Um, why don't you talkto Tracy in HR,and you can getyour start‐paperwork.Cool! Looks I already earned mykeep, huh, Patches?Patches.Yeah. Oh, that's weirdthat you remember that.Um, so, Patches.I'll tell them.Uh, firstday at Hooli,I wore this sweater that hadthese, like, elbow pads on it.‐Anyway, uh‐‐‐HooliPhones?Are you fucking serious?You just laid down and letthat guy roll all over us.Look, I don't wanna use Hoolishit anymore than you guys,but this is for the greatergood of the company.This will get usto a working test.This will get us to Hawaii.Hey! Holden.I asked for a water.‐Thank you.‐Mm‐hmm.Oh...

You don't mentor,you don't volunteer,you don't developprograms for women.You've never shown the slightestinterest in supporting women.Of course I have!Which is whyI wanna do your panel withSusan Wojcicki from YouTube.Well...we do have a lotof funny people.You could add... balance.Are you eatingthe entire leaf?It's amazing how wastefulpeople in the West can be.Gavin:Hoover.This book will send shockwavesthroughout the Valley.Cold Ice Creamand Hot Kisses.This is about yourexperience at Hooli?No, no.It's a coming‐of‐age storyabout a lost,yet handsome teengrowing upone fateful summer in Maine.Now, get thatto the publishers.I want the hardback in my handby tomorrow lunchtime.Sir, it takesa bit longer than that.We have to send it out to publishinghouses and then find an editor.Editors are for people who can'twrite correctly the first time.We'll self‐publish.And this really isn'tabout tech?No. I've left tech for good.Now, I have a chanceto do something important.Write a thinly veiledroman à clefset in a whale‐themed B and B.Richard: So look, Monica, um,I was looking over the org chart,and I think I'm gonna putyou in charge of Foxhole.‐What?‐Yeah.I mean, while I knowthat you and I were sayingthat maybe some people might findit a little misogynist or offensive.I think that we if we hada woman at the helm,it might change the optics,and since you don't really care‐‐No, I‐I‐I do care.I care deeply.No, you don't. I mean,you literally said,"If a bunch of dumbMarines wanna cheaton their dumb wives,what the fuck do I care?"I don't think I usedthose exact words.I'm pretty sureyou did, actually.‐You texted it to me last night, see?‐No, but‐‐And then you also said,"We don't have to smell it.We just have to sell it."‐As long as those fatfat fatties‐‐" ‐Okay.I took an Ambienlast night, and probablyshould've turned off my phone.Can you delete those?Okay. Monica,just make it work.Please?

Hey, Patches!Hey! Uh, Holden said that wewere having this thing upstairs.Yeah, I moved it down here.It's just a better space.Go ahead, have a seat.You're over there.I said we should waitfor you to start, but‐‐The clock is ticking, though, right?We have stuff to do.Busy, busy.Oh.Elbow pads.Weird. Yeah, okay.Uh, actually, the first dayI was at Hooli‐‐Yeah, I told them. I told them.They all laughed.‐‐Oh. Heh.Come on,put it on, Patches.‐I don't wanna put it on.‐Do it! Be fun!Yeah, okay, sure.I can be fun.It's kinda funny, I guess.Yes!There he is!- ‐There's our Patches!- ‐Hey, listen, Richard.You know I'm just jokingaround with you, right?We're all just having fun.Thanks for being a good sport, okay?Sure.

Heavy.I rejected Richard,and every person who hasever offered me safe harbor,and it has to stop.I have to commit to Gwart.No matter how difficult it gets,even if we're miserabletogether, I am goingto support her work,and bring her food,and‐and put her in herprescription sleeping bagwhen she starts to thrash.It is the only path forward.Hey, that'sthe best, man.I feel like you madea lot of progress.‐Ha!‐Gwart's doll gloves.I'm gonna make her so happy.My book isa fucking disaster.What have you got there?Oh, um,MSNBC wanted to interviewyou about beingan "anti‐tech evangelist."Their words.I told them you only wantedto speak about two things:cold ice cream,and hot kisses.Who‐who was it?Was it Hayes or O'Donnell?Maddow, sir.‐Really?‐Yes.I'm sure all the major outletswould love to have you...if you discuss tech.So...Do I honor my truthas a starving author,or do I return tothe world I've scorned?What did Publisher's Weeklysay about my book?Publisher's Weekly is a...terrible magazine, sir.Call Maddow.Yes, sir.Bishop to E6.‐Checkmate.‐Fuck.Okay, so that's...42 gamesfor me, and...zero for you.You wanna play again?I think I'll take a break.Okay.Okay.‐ ‐Swisher:Well, thank you so muchfor the hilarious SusanWojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.It's gonna be a veryhard act to follow,but here to try is Monica Hall,the CFO of Pied Piper.Come on up, Monica.‐Thank you for coming, Monica.‐Thank you.I was thrilledand surprised to be invited.So, let's cutright to the chase.You recently acquired Hooli,and one ofits propertiesis Foxhole, whichis apparently an appthat military members useto source prostitutes.Yes, and that's somethingI'm not involvedwith on any level.It's being run nowby a young womanI promoted,Priyanka Singh.I talked to Priyankabefore this panel.Priyanka, are youin this audience?‐Yes, hi! ‐Hey, Priyanka.How you doing?Why don't you get upand tell us about it?Well,when I first took overthe app, I was pretty lost,but, luckily, I was able to call onmy network of strong, female coders.And almostimmediately, we came upwith a plan to rebuild Foxholefrom the bottom up.Our first step will be to unionizethe sex workers on the app.We believe that friendswith benefits deserve benefitsbecause sex work is work.And! And!Why is it only for men?Don't our female soldiers, whoput their bodies in harm's way,deserve to put theirbodies in pleasure's way?I think it might be a goodidea to bring Priyanka up here.‐Priyanka, why don't you come up?‐Uh, okay.Swisher:So, Priyanka,the businessof sex positive feminism...Monica, move.Like we say at Foxhole,if you can scale Tinder,you can scalesex positive feminism.‐‐There's a seat in back.You.- ‐Who are you?- ‐Ethan.
