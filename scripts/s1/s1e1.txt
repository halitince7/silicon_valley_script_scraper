Whoo!Yeah!Somebody makesome motherfucking noise in here!Fuck these people.Man, this place is unbelievable.Fucking Goolybib, man.Those guys builda mediocre piece of software,that might be worth something someday,and now they live here.There's money flying all over SiliconValley but none of it ever seems to hit us.What the hell are you eating?Liquid shrimp. It's 200 dollars a quart.Wylie Dufresne made it.How does it taste?Like how I would imagine cum tastes.You guys taking it all in?Because this is what it looks likewhen Google acquires your companyfor over 200 million dollars.Look, Dustin Moskovitz.Elon Musk, Eric Schmidt.Whatever the fuck the guy's nameis who created Photrio.I mean, Kid Rock is thepoorest person here.Apart from you guys.Okay, there's 40 billion dollarsof net worth walking around this party.And you guys are standingaround drinking shrimpand talking about what cum tastes like.Yeah, I heard that.You guys live in my incubator.You've got to network.That's why I brought you here.Uh, I got us in here.Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.Yeah, but I drove.Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.It's amazing how the menand women at these thingsalways separate like this.Yeah, every party in Silicon Valleyends up like a Hasidic wedding.Not even the Goolybib guyswere talking to girls.They don't have to, Big Head.This house talks to girls.Hello! Whoo!I got seven words for you.I loveGoolybib'sintegrated-multi-platform-functionality!Yeah!- All right!- Whoo!Yeah!But seriously,you know, a few days ago, when wewere sitting down with Barack Obama,I turned to these guys and said,"Okay, you know, we're makinga lot of money.""And yes, we're disrupting digital media.""But most importantly,""we're making the world a better place.""Through constructing elegant hierarchiesfor maximum code reuse and extensibility."So, everyone.Here's to many more nightsjust like this one.Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.What a dick.Big Head, there is a personal ad sectionon this Asperger site.Holy shit, this one is looking fora "relationship that has the potentialto become sexual in nature."Boy, is she on the spectrum.She can't even make eye contactwith the camera.Richard, can I talk to you for a second?- Solo.- Mmm-hmm.We need to talk about Pied Piper.What about it? Thewebsite's up and running,I'm just redesigning the compression.It just needs users.Yeah, no shit.But even if somebody wanted to use it,they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.It's incomprehensible.Now, Richard,when you pitched me Pied Piperyou said it was gonna be,"The Google of Music."Which is a really radway to pitch something.I mean, I liked it.I thought it had applications.No, it has all that.Look, when it blows up,and it will once it reachesa critical mass of users,Pied Piper will be able to searchthe whole world of recorded musicto find out if there's a match to see ifyou're infringing on any copyrighted material.So, if you're a songwriter or a band...Okay, first of all, nobody gives a shitabout stealing other people's music, okay?Everybody involved in the music industryis either stealing it or sharing it.They're all a bunch of assholes,especially Radiohead.- Look, Richard...- No.Yeah, they're assholes.Now, look, Richard, ifyou want to live here,- you've got to deliver.- Mmm.I can't have dead weightat my incubator, okay?Either that, or show some promise,for fuck's sake.Like NipAlert, Big Head's app.It gives you the locationof a woman with erect nipples.Now, that's something people want.Richard, you need to getin touch with humanity.When I sold my company, Aviato,I wanted to give back.That's why I started this place,to do something big. To make a difference.You know, like Steve.Um...Jobs or Wozniak?Uh, Steve Jobs or Steve...Oh, I heard you.- Which one?- Jobs.I mean, Jobs was a poser.He didn't even write code.You just disappeared up your own asshole.- You know that? You did.- Well, technically...Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.He knew how to package the ideas,but it was Wozniak that...What is Hooli? Excellent question.Hooli isn't just another high tech company.Hooli isn't just about software.Hooli... Hooli is about people.Hooli is about innovative technologythat makes a difference,transforming the world as we know it.Making the world a better place,through minimal messageoriented transport layers.I firmly believe we canonly achieve greatnessif first we achieve goodness.Erlich is gonna kick me out.And I can't afford to pay rent here.It's insane. $2800 a month,$4500 a month, with five people.Jesus! Why is it so expensive here?Look at this place, it's a shithole.Uh-oh.Here's another one.Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.There she goes.Oh, God, the marketing teamis having another bike meeting.Douchebags.Just another day inside theGavin Belson cult compound.Hey, did you hearwhat Peter Gregory is doing?You mean buying that island in the Pacific?No, he's building one actually.Baller.Anyway, he's also offering 100Kto people willing to skip or drop outof college to pursue their idea.I don't know what happened to that guy,but he really hates college.Anyway, he's doing a TED Talksin Palo Alto tonight.- Should we try to get in?- I dropped out of college.Maybe I should re-enrolland drop out again.Try and get the money.Brogrammers.Oh, no, no.Hey, a double macchiato for me, dude.Yeah.Hey, Rico, you been working out?No. No, I have not.I don't have time to even if I wanted to.I'm too busy working on my website.Uh, I just, I don't want to end upbeing a Hooli lifer.You know, working here forever.Yeah, working for the mostinnovative company in the world,with top pay and vested stock options.I can totally see whyyou wouldn't want that.Yeah, you're like an artist.An entrepreneur.An iconoclast.I don't know, maybe.Dude, we're just messing with you.But we really want to help youwith your site. What's it called?Pied Piper.- Dude, sounds amazing.- Yeah.Why don't you shoot it over to usand we'll give it a look.Maybe we can help.- Uh, really?- Yeah.Okay, yeah...I mean it's always goodto have more eyes on it.Look, it's sending... Sent it.Oh. You're making fun of me.- Dude, no.- No, you are.- No, Ricky, man.- Ricky. Ricky, come back.It's actually Richard, so that's...- Pied wiper.- Wide diaper.Gates, Ellison,Jobs, Dell...All dropped out of college.Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovationbecause of drop outs.Collegehas become a cruel, expensive jokeon the poor and the middle classthat benefits only the perpetrators of it.The bloated administrators.You are a dangerous man,spewing ignorance!I don't think so.I'm just saying peopleshould trust themselvesmore than a system that happily churns outunemployed debtorsand provides dubious value.The true value of a college educationis intangible.The true value of snake-oilis intangible as well.Fascist.- Anything?- Eh.The usual riffs on Twitter and lnstagram.Nothing I'd fund.Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory? Um...I have an idea I'd love to pitch you,if you have time.Ooh.Uh...Well, that is before I just give upand go back to college.Don't... Do not do that.Go work at Burger King.Go into the woods and foragefor nuts and berries.Do not go back to college!I think I have been played.Fine. Go ahead and pitch.You have until I fastenthe seatbelt in my car.Thank you so much. Uh...Pied Piper is a proprietary sitethat lets you find outif your music is infringingon any existing copyrights.So, imagine you were a songwriter, okay?I don't think I could write a song.Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.I don't even think I could say,"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.Crunching all those songs to find matchessounds like it would takeincredible processing power.- I mean...- Yes.Yes, it does.No, no. It's... I made an algorithm.Look, why don't you send me a link toyour project and we'll take a look.Okay, yeah, great.I put the prototype up on Github.Pied Piper. I'll look it up.It's like the fable with the kidsand then the rats and the music.That is a narrow car.Fucking billionaires.Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?Yes, I do.You have to downloadyour own media player?Oh. Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.Wait a sec.What is this file size?1.2 megabytes? No way.Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.The file size is like, half.And look how fast this search is.Holy shit, how did itfind a match that fast?It's like it's searching compressed files?No way.Look at that Weissman score.2.89.Hey, where have you two been?We're playing the multi-channel router teamin five minutes.Okay, how the hell did he do this?And the compression is totally lossless.And he's somehow figured out a wayto do a search on a compressed data space.- Holy shit.- Yeah.And I don't think he even realizeswhat he has here.He's using it for somesilly songwriter app.All these guys are like that,they're all about consumer facing.Right, but you take something like this,make it business facingand use it for enterprise,the applications could be endless.Hey, Gilfoyle, I thoughtyou were a Satanist?I'm a LaVeyan Satanistwith some theistic tendencies.Oh, some theistic tendencies.Well then, what's with the cross?It's an upside down cross.Not from here it isn't.Oh, I see, you know what you should do?You should get another tattoothat says, "This side up" on it.How does this translate into Farsi?That's not the language I speak.Frontier Airlines just happenedto like mine, Aviato.And that's how I got to where I am.So, what do you got?Okay, here it is.Bit Soup.It's like alphabet soup,but it's ones and zeros,instead of the letters.'Cause it's binary.You know, binary is just ones and zeroes.Yeah, I know what binary is.Jesus Christ!I memorized the hexadecimal times tableswhen I was 14 writing machine code!Okay? Ask me what nine times F is.It's fleventyfive.I do not need you tellingme what binary is,just like I don't need you thinkingabout soup or taking pictures of it.I need you thinking aboutapps, software, websites.This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...Paris, Texas.Hmm.That's where Campbell's Soup is.It's the Hooli number again.It's probably those brogrammers.Can't wait to tell me howstupid my website is.Assholes.Hello, Richard Hendricks.I'm a total fucking retard.Uh, hi, this is JaredDunn calling from Hooli.I'm calling on behalf of Gavin Belson.I didn't... Hi.Gavin is very excitedabout your Pied Piper applicationand we were wondering if you could come infor a sit-down with us.- Are you available now?- Okay.- Sure.- Okay, we'll be here.Yes. Good-bye.Uh...I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.He likes Pied Piper.- Holy shit.- I own 10% of Pied Piper.You said it was a shitty idea.It was a shitty idea.I'm not sure what it is now.- What time's the meeting?- Right now.I'm gonna need a better shirt.Holy shit.- What the fuck am I waiting for?- Uh, see ya.Well, it's like Gavin always says,"it takes change to make change."Uh, yeah, I think I'veseen that written around.- Hey.- Hi.Gavin is running 30 minutes latebut you should know,he is very excited to see you, Richard.Oh.He's with his spiritual advisor.He shouldn't be that much longer.I'm a VP here and I only get to see himabout 10 minutes a month.Yeah, but that 10 minutesis just incredible.I heard Richard Hendricks was here.Have you ever met Gavin before?- No.- No?Oh, I told him, it's amazing.That hardly begins to describe it.It's weird.They always travel in groups of five.These programmers, there'salways a tall skinny white guy,short skinny Asian guy,fat guy with a ponytail,some guy with crazy facial hairand then an East Indian guy.It's like they trade guysuntil they all have the right group.You clearly have a greatunderstanding of humanity.And Gavin said, "I'm not humiliating you,I'm elevating you."Oh, Gavin...This is Richard.It's Peter Gregory.Uh...No.Come on, Big Head.Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...Why are you going that fast?'Cause we've got a meetingwith Gavin Belson.Pick up the pace.- We honestly don't.- Come on.I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson'soffice right now, Mr. Gregory.Uh, here he comes, so can I call you backin a second?So, Richard Hendricks is here!- There you are, Richard.- Hi.So sorry these gentlemanhave kept you waiting.- That's fine.- So here's the thing.I love what you did.- Really?- Fill him in, Jared.Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possiblythe most progressive company in the world.Part of that is Gavin'scommitment to social justice,but part of it is his personal commitmentto the people that work at Hooli.In that spirit Gavin is prepared togive you a very substantial raise,and a promotion to go with it.I own 10 percent.He created it while living in my incubator.Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.I don't know what any of that means,but I'll give you 600thousand dollars for it.We have the reach and the resourcesto take what you have doneand push it to the global level.That is a generous offer. I, um...Shit, sorry. Hello.Really? No shit, that's...Uh, yeah, yeah. No, here.It's Peter Gregory.Not sure how he got my number.Uh, this is Richard.I'll give you $3 million for itright now!Uh...Gavin Belson just offered me$3 million for Pied Piper.I'm prepared to give you $300,000.Peter Gregory just offered me 300...Did you say thousand dollars?For 10% of your company.Okay, 4 million.200,000.- For 5%.- Huh?You just went down.No, you're still valuedat four million dollars.But you own 95%of a potential billion-dollar company.And not just that,I will help you build this company.I will introduce youto the people you need to knowand provide the counsel that you need.I will take a small piece,but the company will belong to you.Not Gavin Belson.You have until tomorrow to decide.Uh...Okay.- Um, you know...- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.I'm offering you$4 million right now.Mmm...I'm...That is a lot of money.You know, I actually have to...I've got to go to the bathroom.I've got to pee.It's desperate. I'm bursting.I'll be right back, but right now...Okay, 10 million.No. Maybe.I didn't mean to snap at you.I'll talk in a bit.Won't be long.Little more about me.I am the founder of Aviato, and I owna very small percentage of Grindr.It's a men to men dating sitewhere you can find other menwithin 10 miles of youinterested in having sexual intercoursein a public restroom.In the homosexual communitythere's sometimes anonymous...I know what Grindr is.I have gay friends.So you will survive.It's just a garden variety panic attack.Welcome to Silicon Valley.We see people like you all the time.- Really?- Yes.It's just I have to makethis decision by tomorrow.Yeah. You know, a while back,we had a guy in herein almost the exact same situation,"Take the money or keep the company."What happened?Well, a couple months later,he was brought into the ERwith a self-inflicted gunshot wound.I guess he really regrettednot taking that money.He shot himself becausehe turned down the money?Yeah.Or no, he took the money.Or no.No, he did not. I don't... You know what?I don't remember. But whatever it was,he regretted it so muchthat he ended up shooting himself.- And now he's blind.- He's blind?Yeah, just FYI,if you're ever gonna shoot yourself,don't hold the gun up to your temple, okay?Because that just basically took outboth of his optic nerves and then,you know, half of his face.And then his wife left him,because, you know...- Yikes.- Right.He may have been a genius programmerbut not so muchin human anatomy.Or decision making, for that matter.Now he's got to live with all thatand whatever terrible decisionhe made about the money.Uh, and what do I do if I feelanother panic attack coming on?Mmm. Would you be interested in a devicethat links up to your smartphoneand it keeps track of your vitalsand it tells you, evenbefore it's happening,whether you're having a panic attackor an actual heart attack?Yeah, that sounds great.You would, right? Okay, that's great news.Because it's still in prototype phaseright now,but my start-up partnersand I are looking for investors.Like today. So will youplease let me know...I'm going to give you my number.If you do end up takingthat 10 million dollarsbecause we could reallymake the world a better place.Whoa!Oh, jeez!Richard.Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.- We met outside the TED...- Yeah, I remember you.What... How'd you know I was here?Peter Gregory is invested in a companythat uses GPS in phones to track people.That's creepy.You don't know the half of it.And neither does Congress.- Are you okay?- Look, I don't want to waste your time.I think I gotta takethe money from Gavin Belson.At least this way when I blow my eyeballs outI'll have some money left for my family.Jesus.Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yoursis a compression algorithmthat blew our engineering team away.And what do you think Hooliis going to do with it?I don't know. That's their business.This is your baby.Do you even realize the impactthat a compression this goodcould have on the world?Getting any file on your mobile phonein an instant.Navigation data for self-driving cars,mobile medical imagery,all transmitting with no quality loss.This is game-changing.And don't you want to bein the driver's seat when that happens?You really want to justturn it all over to Hooli and walk away?Well, you are not makingthis easier for me.I'm not trying to.I mean, you're actually making it worse.My hands are tingling.I have this metal taste in my mouth.Actually, I can't go back in there,so I'm going to go home.- Let me give you a ride home.- Good to see you again.Uh, okay. Thanks.Dude, where have you been?Why won't you answer your phone?Man, this has grownway beyond AngelList, man.Andreesen, Elevation and like a bunch ofother seed firms are piling onto this thing.I mean, they've been calling Erlich.He's out of control.Yeah.What if we took Peter Gregory's 200Kand built our own company?I'm sorry. You said "we."Who's that in reference to exactly?You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.I mean, right now PiedPiper just does audio,but I'm thinking of waysto compress images, video...I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.Maybe this thing could be huge.Look, guys, for thousands of yearsguys like ushave gotten the shit kicked out of us.But now, for the first time,we are living in an erawhere we can be in chargeand build empires.We could be the Vikings of our day.- Vikings?- How are you feeling?You look super fucked up, to be honest.Who ate my fucking quinoa again?So you're really about to go tell Erlichthat he's not going to get his $1 million?Yeah, I don't want to be therewhen you do that.I would like to be there when you do that.No, just stay here, please.Hey-Um...So, I've been thinking about this wholePeter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.And, um, I think I'm goingto go with Peter Gregory.- Uh, which I know means...- Richard.I know that you look at me,and see a guy who has it all figured out.And for the most part, you're right, I do.When I sold Aviato,it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,the universal respect of all the ladies.But there's always been a hole in my heart.Not a literal hole like you would findin some babies with congenital diseases,but a metaphorical hole.I guess that hole is the "What if."What if I didn't sell?I'll never know.And so I guess what I'msaying to you now is,you're like me, Richard.You want to build somethingand see it through.Uh, so, just to be clear.You're all right with me saying no to a dealthat will net you a million dollars outright?No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.I'm excited about it.Let's see how high thisrocket can fly, partner.Okay. Great.That's great. Uh...Not partners, exactly.But everything else is great.Call it what you want.Always blue, always blue, always blue,always blue, always blue, always blue,always blue, always...Oh, that was a yellow.What was that, 17?- It's pretty good.- Hey, guys...Guys, can I just kind of saysomething real quick?I know it's stupid but...I just want to say, uh,I'd like for this companyto just be different than Hooliand Goolybib and all the rest, you know?Like, let's like not turn thisinto a corporate cultwith bike meetings and voluntary retreatsthat are actually mandatory.And claiming to make the worlda better place all the time.Let's, uh... Let's just think different.Uh, don't think different. That's Apple.Let's just... Let's just do it.- That's Nike, man.- I know that's Nike.- Yeah.- Uh...Fuck it. I don't know.Let's just make it... Let's make it happen.Yeah, agreed.To his beneficence.Peter Gregory?- The dark lord.- Of course, the dark lord.Big Head.God, he's worse high.Always blue, always blue,always blue, always blue, always blue...Always blue, always...
