I sent you 63 good people.You have to choose.They haveto meet our rigorous standards.I mean, look at the threewe've already hired.Stallions.Hooli is the future,and your future is...The Box 2.Are there any questions?Everything you're doing hereis antiquated.Fuck you guys.Get out of here.You wish to acquirea company called Sliceline?I will be taking on a totalengineering team of about 50.Um... Wha...Don'ttell anyone, okay? -Um...My Tesla finally came.Was that a wise purchase?Considering Richard justobliterated Pied Piper's runwayhiring all those coders?I ordered it a month ago.But still, it's an investment.As I understand,cars depreciate10 percentas soon as theyfall off the truck.Like that.So if the car costs $100,well you just lost $10.Did it cost $100?Or more?It's not about the money.I, my friend, am now partof the green revolution.Are you?Most electricitystill comes fromgas plants andcoal-burning smoke stacks.Do you know whereyour electricity comes from?- No.- Mm-hmm.Look how shiny it is.Plus, it has a frunk...A front trunk.Here, hop in, let megive you a ride to work.Dinesh,you like this?Jesus fucking Christ!- Is that a dead pig?- Yes.It's just like Errich.My corrupt unclesent a death certificatefrom Chinabut to send bodyis too expensive.So...I cremate a pigbecause a pig ismost like a fat human.I gotta get to work.Dinesh...can you takepig to backyard?I need to burn it.No.That's odd.You left before me.How was I ableto park before you?I guess all 50of the new employeesdecided to show upbright and earlyfor the fuckingall-hands meeting.I had to park on level five.Huh! So unlike you,the world understandsthat I'm saving the planetand has rewarded me with...primo spot.Congratulations.You've finally takenyour rightful spotamongst the handicapped.*SILICON VALLEY*Season 05 Episode 02Episode Title : "Reorientation"Is it broken?Uh, no.I think I'm okay.One question,what the fuck happened?'Cause... you weredoing your speechright there in frontof the whole company,and then...Wow.Well...uh, my speech was going poorly.- Agreed.- Yeah.And I started to panic.With good reason.And then...all of a sudden, I...I thought I hadto shit my pants, okay?And that's why you jumpedface first intoa glass wall?No, it all happened so fast,but... essentially, I thought,if it was gonna happen,I didn't want to be standing.So, I crouched, because...If you wannashit yourself,you'd rather becrouching than standing?Yes. I mean, if you had to.I hate to say this,but I follow you.The thing is, when Icrouched, I had to burp.But since I was all,you know, tucked up,I actuallyvomited a little.And then, that's when myfight-or-flight reflex kicked in.Do you ever fight?Okay, fine, then my "or flight"reflex kicked in and I just...Pow.Yeah.Okay. Well, what we sawwas a very oily manin mid-sentence dip down,vomit, and thenthrust himself violentlyface first intoa glass wall.But I guess it's a lotless embarrassingthe way you explain it.Richard, what about...Did you evacuatein your pants?Oh, no, uh, good news.I think what happenedwhen I hit the glass,I sort of shocked myself.Now, I don't have to.That's actuallykind of disappointing,because, like,no closure.Well, on the bright side,it'll be that much easierto get you cleaned upand back out there.What? I have you scheduled forthree more days of orientation.No way. Cancel them.There's no wayI'm going back out there.Especially after knowingwhat they saw.No, fuck it. Plus, I'm...I'm way too busy, so.Gentlemen, could wehave the room please?So we can leave?Sweet.Richard,look out there.There's Optimoji and Slicelinet-shirts left and right.These are conquered soldiersstill in their old uniforms.But we need everyone hereto be Pied Pipers.I mean, you're asking themto spend the primesof their lives on your vision.Right? And you need to goout there and lead them.They're... they're yearningfor inspiration.I can't do inspiration.I'm a coder.Look there,the new Internet.That's inspiration.Use that.Richard, this is all an idea.And people don'twanna follow an idea,they wanna follow a leader.Look at the last guyto create a new Internet.Al Gore.His ideas were excellent,but he talked like anarcoleptic plantation owner,so he lost the presidencyto a fake cowboyand now he makesapocalypse porn.Look, the point is, youneed to lead with passion.When you set your mind to it,you're one of the most charismaticpeople I've ever met.And I have met Ira Glass.I know it's three dayswe could be working,but ultimately, a unified teamwill save us time in the end.You wanna save time?If you wanna save time,here's what you do.You said it yourself,okay, the Optimoji guysand the Sliceline guysare separate,with their ownseparate histories,their own separateshorthands,so let's use that.Let's give the schedulerto the Optimoji guys,and the server-less runtimeto the Sliceline guys.Then we have Dinesh and Gilfoyle and theStallions, they do the integration.Boom, we're off and running.How about that?That way, no one has toshit or burp or pukeor get a nosebleedin front of anyone.As for the bezel design,our young aesthete, Dang,has once again spun gold.Let's see it.Wait, my signature's not on it?How could it be the GavinBelson Signature Box IIIwithout Gavin Belson'ssignature on it?Well, the word "signature"has a handwritten feel to it.Why is my signaturenot on this?Gavin, there was a slightissue with your signature.What issue?Do you have a mockPull it up.Ah, yes! There.What's wrong with that?Well, reactions to this fromour testing groups were mixed,so we contacteda handwriting expert.And, uh, well...Jean, do youhave the report?Absolutely.Pleasure to be on your team, Gavin.Here it is."The signaturedisplayed troubling traits."Left of upright slant,"narrow angles,tense strokes,conclusively indicativeof sociopathic tendencies."- What?- "Characterized by"a lack of empathyand need to dominate,"a willingness to hurt othersto achieve one's goals.Inability to accept bad news..."- Hoover?- Sir?Get this horrible womenthe fuck out of my office, now.What the fuck is that?It's the cheapest thingI could findthat qualifiedas an electric vehicle.I found it on Craigslist.Now you get to parkon the fifth floor.Enjoy the drive.Oh, and you were right...it does feel good to bea part of the green revolution.Oh, yeah? Well, does that"vehicle" have "Insane Mode"?One press of a buttonand I go zero to 60in 3.2...What a day.See, we'd still befinishing up orientation,singing Kumbayasand doing trust falls.But instead,both our Optimojiand Sliceline teamshave gone throughtheir first code review.Well, to be fair, I neverwould've scheduled trust falls.I mean, you do one of those,you're so jacked up on adrenaline,the rest of the dayis basically shot.We were gonna have a noncompetitivetalent show with no losers.Not possible.Dick, I just got inand checked the commits.Are you awarethat the Sliceline guyshave been encoding timein nanoseconds,as we usually do,but the Optimoji guyshave been using milliseconds?What?Just the fact thatwe're still calling themSliceline guysand Optimoji guysis sending upall sorts of red flags.And I don't evenmean the word "guys,"which I just learnedis a micro-aggression.It's fine, "guys."I will get themto re-factor their code.We're still aheadof where we'd beif we were doingsome kind of talent show.Richard? Gilfoyle parkedhis electric pile of trashin my Tesla's spot.Do you think that's fair?Not now, Dinesh.Why can't you guysswitch to milliseconds?Why do we have to change?Sorry, well, our entirecode base uses nanoseconds.And you didn't think it wasimportant to tell us this?No, well, I mean, it was...It was part of the orientationthat was scheduled,which had to be,for numerous reasons,uh, canceled.And I'm sorry about that,I know it sucks.If I could make itsuck less, I would, but...You could get somedecent coffee in here.What? What's wrong with...Philz Coffee?That's high-end joe, bro.At Optimoji, we had Stumptownbrought in every day.So that would inspire you?Different coffee?Inspire us?You know what?Bup, bup, bup!Stumptown it is.You got it.And you'll tell your guysabout the nanoseconds?Yeah.Unless you wannaget up in front of everyoneand announce it yourself.No, no, no,I'd rather you...That was a joke.Your speech was a disaster.Oh.Yeah.You know. Yeah.It was really bad.I know.Okay, Mr. Jian, you havepetitioned this courtto become the sole executorof the estate of Erlich Bachman,is that correct?Yes.I see you've gotall the paperwork, here.Yes. Errich Bachmanis dead.Oh! Um...Mr. Jian, there'sabsolutely no needto displaythe deceased remains.You can put that away.- I have it.- Yes.Please put it down.Errich Bachmanis cremated...into ashes.And I put it in bucket.Put it down, sir.Now, have you determinedto a reasonabledegree of certaintythat Mr. Bachman hasno living next of kin?No wife,children, parents,no brothers, sisters,nieces, nephews,grandparents,children froma predeceased spouseor domestic partnership?No.He died alone.He's a very sad man.So, I have a...a houseand a 10% Pied Piper.In the absenceof any next of kin,I will approve youas the sole beneficiaryand the official executorof Mr. Bachman's estate.But, before you can distributeany of his assetsinto your personal possession,you are required to settle allclaims against the estate.Do you understand?So I get a houseand a 10% Pied Piper?You need to pay allof his outstanding bills.How much do I have to pay?Well, these debts cansometimes be substantial.Would youcharacterize Mr. Bachmanas a financiallyresponsible man?Hey, Sliceline guys,what's up? Heh.So... Um,wanted to talk toyou guys about something.Past couple days,the Optimoji guys have reallystepped up their game,but, um, you guys...have kind of been flagging.I'm just wondering ifeverything's all right.Yeah. Great.Just nice to knowwhere we stand.Sorry?We get it.You only acquired Slicelinebecause you wanted Optimoji.WhatNo, wrong.Uh, why would you say that?I didn't. You did,when you chosetheir coffee over ours.It's bad enoughwe can't have Slice here.Slice?The beverage?No, no. Slice was our mascot.He's really smart.Okay, well...Bring the little guy in.What about the no dog policy?What no dog policy, huh?Really? Are you sure you don'tneed to check with Optimoji?I'm pretty sure,but, uh...Danny- What?- Uh, I just was wonderingif you're coolif the Sliceline guys- brought in their dog.- He's really smart.Well at Optimoji,we had a no dog policy.Come on.Don't be such a dork.Let 'em have it.It's just a dog.Sure. Fine.You're the CEO.Yes, I am.All right.And from this point on,CEO stands forCanine Endorsement...Oh... yeah.All right.Hey, look at youand your 10-speed.Aw, you got up early 'cause youthought you could take my space.That's cute.Almost as cute as your bike.Yeah, I guessthis is a bike, isn't it?So I get to use the bike lane.See you later.No, bikes still haveto follow traffic laws!That's not fair!All right.You wanna get insane?Let's get insane.Whoa!Fuck you, Gilfoyle!Something's wrongwith your frunk.It's all frucked up.Hey, Tesla!You knowwhere Pied Piper is?Right here, guys.What the fuck?Dick?Hey, uh...Explain.Okay, uh...So, Optimoji hada no dog policyand apparently that's becauseevery single one of 'emhave a fucking dog.And when we waived ourno dog policy...You waived our no dog policy?I had Jared put that in therefor a reason, Richard!In Pakistan,dogs are not pets, okay?They're vicious beastsand they chase youdown the streetand they bite you.My cousin Eftaharlost an ear.Our mayor wasvery corrupt.But he put poison pillsin chicken meatto take careof the dog problem.We hailed him as a hero.We put up statuesof him everywhere.He's gonna be okay.Who's gonna be okay?- What?- Stallion down!He's violentlyallergic to dogs.It's another reason for ouriron-clad no dog policy.Jared, when were you planningon telling me all of this?Day two of orientation.Right after safe space charades.So look, we'll pay for yourentire medical bill, obviously.So, you're good.You're coveringhis deductible?Then you haveto cover ours, right?And what about the dogs?They're people, too.They're literally not.They're dogs!Hold strong.Fuck you!Oh.So...Jared, uh, you wanted meto unite the teams and I have.They are united against me.Even the dogs,apparently.I wish they hadyour fecal fortitude.Hey, do me a favor and...just take care of all the dogs.And then call an all-hands.I've clearly gottasay words.Ooh, okay.Really didn't wannabe back up here, again.And I think we allremember why, you know?But you probably don't knowthis, but I almost sh...They don't need to...Farted. Yeah.Which would be embarrassing.Anyway, look, uh...I know I...should be the inspirationfor you guys,but to be honest,that's not really who I am.And if this companylives or diesby all the flowerythings I say,well then, to be honest,we're fucked. Ha.They say that...people don't follow ideas.But I think in this case,you guys should.Because...the idea of creatinga new Internet,that's special.Right? And we've beengiven the opportunityto rewrite...the most important thingin human history.And we can build itthe way it should'vebeen made all along.You know, not thisshitty, addictive parasitethat companies likeHooli use to spy on usand exploit us.Okay?There.That's your inspiration.Not me.Not coffee. Not dogs. So...if I'm not inspirationalenough for you,and if you don'twanna be here,well, then,there's the door.And we'll give youenough severanceto cover you to your next job.But if you wanna stick aroundand build this thing,then we've got work to do.Great job.So what's going on?I hear footsteps.Are... are peoplesitting back down, or...?Okay, they're pickingup their bags.That could be good.Okay. So, what,they're leaving, or...?A few are.Okay, what's a few?It's more than a few.What's that mean? Like,what's more than a few, five?Double digits?It might be easier tosay how many are staying.It's, uh...It's two.What?Okay.So, uh,Richard, what...What do you wanna do here?What are you talking about?I'm doing it.Sorry?I'm a coder, Jared.So I'm gonna code.And if I have to build my entirenew fucking internet by myself,I'll do that, so...Oh, dear.I like it.It's just so edgy.Banksy is a veryedgy artist.The edgiest.What is this?Banksy is insisting hissignature be on his work.This is supposedto be my signature.On what planet does a signaturehave a signature on it?I'm afraid it'snon-negotiable.The fucking ballson this egomaniac.You know what?Fuck Banksy.We're on a campusfull of literally thousandsof the greatestcreative minds in the world.Let's just crowd source it with ouremployees. We'll make it a contest.People will feel empoweredand part of the team.And it won't cost us shit.You see? This is whata benevolent leader does.Make it happen.Sir, is this a good time?It's a great time.I just fired Banksy.Banksy, the vandal?The very one. Now,what do you have for me?Good news.I'm hearing that Pied Piperis in a free-fall.From whom? All I can saywithout implicating youis that I've institutedan operationto safeguard our interests.I'm calling it"Project Washburn."What I'm planning to...Hoover, you'reimplicating me.Are we bad people for leavingRichard there to work by himself?We've been codingfor 48 hours straight.I could give a shit aboutdeontological ethics.Yang.There better not bea Chinaman in my bed.That is racist.Yes.I am racist.Stupid Errich.Big mortgage.Seven credit cards.Not even one with miles.Fucking loser.It almost not worthto take his house from him.Fat fuck.Speaking of crazy bills,you know how much it's goingto cost to fix my Tesla?$17,000.I can't afford to pay that.But I can't affordnot to pay it.If I don't fix my Tesla,Gilfoyle wins.And I need to reallyshove it up his ass.Wait.Do I really hatesomeone so muchthat defeating themis worth more than money?Is that reallywhat I've become?Yeah, it is.I'm gonna pay it.Thanks, Jian-Yang.I'll pay, too.Fuck you, Errich.You can't justleave your bike-carin my Tesla's spotand Uber home.That's not fair, Gilfoyle.Mmm, you don't seemto understand.It's my spot now.What are they doing back?Hey. Where have you been?Sleeping.WhatWe assumed you guys were right behind us.What's happening?Oh!Something.Something is happening.When you left,I thought he was fried.Okay? Because his shoulderswere all tight,and he wouldn't answerto his name,and his eyes went dead,like when I tell himI love him.But then, he just got strongerand he startedpicking up speed,so I texted a fewof the Sliceline guysand then they textedsome of the Optimoji guys,and they allwanted to see it.Richard has finishedthe schedulerand is almostready to mergethe server-less runtime.Look, look!He implementedall those tasks?By himself?That was supposed to takethe whole team four days.It's amazing.I mean, I feel...I feel like Mary Magdaleneon resurrection day.And that's notthe greatest miracle of all.Look. Look at the coders.They're all wearingPied Piper hoodies.He pushed another commit.What the fuck?Flawless. Right?Um, it takes a whileto read a whole commit.They've been cheeringafter every commit.I mean, they haven't,but it's...It's great.I thought Ihad to shit my pants.So, I crouched.I actually vomited.Fight-or-flight reflexkicked in and I just...Richard!Richard?Richard?Hey, buddy boy.Oh, there he is.What's...What's going on?Don't flip out, okay?But you have beenin a coma for four years.What?That's correct.In fact,I'm a robot.The real Dr. Crawforddied heroicallyin the water wars of 2020.Jokes, Richard!I'm just joking around.What, did you sellyour sense of humor?You've just been outfor about six hours.You were not even unconscious,really just asleep.But you did losea whole lot of blood.I just hope theyput the right kind back in.Wait, are youstill riffing?I don't know.Richard, here's the bad news,your arms and your torsotook the brunt of the glass.If you'd cut your face up some,we could've gotten insuranceto pay for a whole remodel.Gotta, you know...give the old schnozzlea much-needed trim,you knowwhat I'm talking about.You gotta hate itas much as everybody else.So what happened?What were you,trying to ride oneof those hover boardsaround your officelike a nincompoop?Um, no.I... I guess I just gota little lost in the work.All right.Hop in, Frankenstein.Let's get you out of here.Oh, uh...I think whatyou're trying to say isFrankenstein's monster.What?I think you mean to call meFrankenstein's monster'cause Frankenstein is the...Oh, you're oneof those guys, huh?No, I'm just... the doctor'sname is Frankenstein...I know. It's just anannoying thing to point out.If you wantpeople to like you,just go along with whatthey say and have fun.What?Richard!You should've called.I would've picked you up.What's everybody doing here?The fuck does it look like?We're working.Look at 'em all, Richard.I mean, sure,a three-day orientationmight've been just aseffective and less bloody,but it wasn't you.But you found your own wayto get these men and women,these Pipers, to follow you.You looked at these peopleand you said,"I may not bean inspiring speaker."I may be twitchy,"and I might be strange,"and I might vomitand I might defecate in my pants"and I might throwmyself through a window."But I believe inthis company so much,I'll work so hard, I'llliterally risk my life for it."And that is the kind of leaderthese people wanna follow.Because now they knownothing is gonna stop you.All right, then.Gavin Belson's office, please?I need to talk to Hoover.It's Jeff Washburn.Yes, thank you.This one came in thirdwith 46 votes.Cute. Next?This one came in secondwith 374 votes.Nice, feels solid.And with 9,986 votes this,by far, was Hooli's favorite.Hmm, I like it.It's bold.Gavin B.Mr. Hoover?You have a phone call.He said you'd knowwhat it was regarding.A Mr. Jeff Washburn.I am so exhausted.But the backseat of my Tesla'sreally comfy though,right, Richard?Definitely worth allthe money I'm spending on it.Good purchase.Not a mistake.Uh...my key doesn't work.Uh, let me try mine.What the fuck?Mine doesn't work either.Yang.
