Same as yours.I mean, not exactly the same.I ordered the P100D.Newer model.It's got longerbattery life--You know what?This is a workplace.This is not a fuckingslumber party,gabbing, gabbing.And series Bis not a done deal.Despite what myface says, okay?Don't trust this face.No one should evertrust this face.Congrats on the Tesla, Danny.So excited for you.Series B, baby!Fuck Danny.I mean, I love my Tesla.It has Insane Mode,which means it goeszero to 60 in 3.2 seconds,which is literally insane.But the Teslathat Danny orderedhas Ludicrous Mode,which means it goeszero to 60 in 2.8 seconds.So it's gonna take mean entire 0.4 secondslonger to get to 60.I mean, how would you feelif one of your neighborsgot a tiki headbigger than yours?Oh, well,when we bought it,we made sure it wasthe biggest onethey made, so.You're the biggesttiki head guyin the neighborhood.I used to bethe Tesla guyin the office.I maxed out my credit cardsto be able to afford that thing.And now thatwe're getting series B,any one of these bourgeoisnew money millennial fuckscan just go out and buy one.I don't wanna sound selfish,but sometimes I wishonly I made money.You know?What are wetalking about, here?You want us to launcha cryptocurrency?I do.The fact that people are willingto pay many multiples morefor our compute creditsthan they're worth,we have an opportunity here.Worth is relative, Richard.What do you mean?Why do people covetthe silly piecesof green cotton paperin their wallets?It's becausewe are all sheep.And we've mutually agreedto endow certain thingswith value.And right now,for some reason,the market values ourcredits more than we did.Gilfoyle, we're notgonna suddenly pivotand become a digitalcurrency company.I'm not proposing a pivot.I'm proposing thatwe sell digital currencyas a way to financeour new Internet company.You wantedan alternativeto Laurie Bream.Well, it's right herein front of you.PiedPiperCoin.Okay, look, I...I'm not gonna betthe entire futureof my new Internetand everythingI've worked foron becoming the next Bitcoin.You really expect meto do that?There are very few thingsthat I will defendwith true passion:medical marijuana,the biblical Satan as a metaphorfor rebellion against tyranny,and mother fuckingGoddamn cryptocurrency.Mmm.I have a PowerPointthat I've been wantingto show you for some time.Gavin:Walk me through this.We can't makeour boxes in Chinabecause Yao has threatenedevery manufacturerin the country.That's right.We can't afford Bangladesh,because the workershave unionized.Sadly, correct.And we can't useour place in Laos,because one persongets her scalp ripped offand suddenly, everyone'sscreaming regulations.Yes.You know, you heara lot of chatterabout the growthof the global economy,but no one wants totalk about the downside.Gavin, there is one othermanufacturing optionwe haven't discussed yet,which consideringthe current circumstances,might be worth consideration.I'm open to anything.America.Fuck you.I feel the same way.But we were recently contactedby the mayor ofGoldbriar, North Carolina.They had a DVRmanufacturing plantthat closed.The retooling would be minimal.Scott:They've gota skilled labor pooljust sitting idleand they sound desperate.Really?How desperate?It was pitiful.Really?In 350 BCE,Aristotle definedsound money as beingdurable, transferable,divisible, scarce,recognizable....Gilfoyle?and fungible.What?Can we skip ahead 2,400 years?I mean, I knowwhat cryptocurrency is.Richard, a lot of workwent into this presentation.Okay.Fine.But you're missing outon a lot of wisdom, here.Why don't you tell mewhat you knowabout Bitcoinas a jumping-off point?Okay, sure.Uh, well, I'm pretty sureit was founded bya Japanese guy...Or guys, or girls,going by the nameSatoshi Nakamoto in 2008.True identity still unknown.Okay, look, every dayI read an articleabout how we're ina Bitcoin bubble.And who is writingthose articles?I don't wanna saythe establishment.But is it possible thatWarren Buffettcalled Bitcoina pyramid schemebecause he has 92 billionconventional dollars to protect?Let's say he's right.Let's say Bitcoin dies.So what?MySpace, Friendster,they both died.But they paved the wayfor other social media tripelike Facebook and Twitterto completelyoverrun the planet.Crypto is out there.And it's not going away.It just feels sketchy.In the same way thata new Internetis sketchy, Richard?Well--What is crypto?If not decentralized,anonymous, secure,and an existential threatto the powers that be?I would think that you'd beall-in on something like that.Yeah. But do you really thinkwe can create a currencyworth $30 million?Because that's whatwe'd be giving up.Maybe. Probably even more.But even if it's less,we would still gaincontrol, autonomy,board seats and shares,and you wouldn't have to relyon a VC who once fired youfrom your own company.So, there is a modeabove Ludicrous Mode.Am I correct?Yes. It's called Plaid.And it comes standardon the new Tesla Roadster.How do I getinto one of these babies?Simple. You put downa $50,000 deposit today.Okay.And you'll be behind the wheelas soon as theybecome available.And how quicklywill that be, Stephanie?Soon. We're thinkinga few years,which goes by fast.My daughter wasa teenager in high school.Next thing I knew...I'm gonna stop youright there.Your oily salesmanshipis starting to reallyirritate me.Okay?I need to maintainmy Tesla superiority,and I need to do it now.Okay, I'm looking ata new set of wheels here.The 21-inch Arachnids.Very nice.But they're not for sale.You can only get themthrough our referralawards program.You refer threeother customers to us,they buy a vehicleand, zoop-zoop,you get the wheels.So, if I get morepeople to buy Teslas,then I will have the wheelsand no one else can get them?Not even Danny?I'm sorry, who's Danny?He's the guywith the shitty wheels.Major Wilkins:And now, the CEO of Hooli,Mr. Gavin Belson.(cheers and applause)Thank you, Mayor Wilkins.Thank you, Goldbriar, for thiswarm, wonderful welcome.You know, beingin North Carolinaalways feels like a bitof a homecoming for me.I own a vacation propertyjust off the coast in Bermuda.Technically, it ismy primary legal residence.Good people of Goldbriar,for too long, foreign interestshave used unfair tradeand labor practicesto plunder American wealthand steal American jobs.But I don'tblame them for that.No. I blame weak, spinelessAmerican politicians.But if your mayordoes his job,your jobs will come back,and soon, you willproudly be buildingthe Gavin BelsonSignature Box Three.(applause)But if for some reasonhe can't make myvery reasonable proposal work,you know who to blame.I'm excited to get started.What about y'all?(cheers and applause)(marching band plays)♪ ♪(dramatic sting)♪ ♪(sighs)Jared: Hi, Holden.Oh.(dramatic sting)Jared.
