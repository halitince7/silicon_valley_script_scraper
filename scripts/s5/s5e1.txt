All right, let's do an exercise.You can build anythingin the world you wantwith your compression.What's it gonna be?Three, two, one, go.A-- A new internet.WhatI am your lead investor.You will respect me as such.I do not respect youbecause you are fat and poor.So, you're telling me thatthe perfect applicationof my algorithm belongsto Gavin fucking Belson?We needhis patent and his funding.Eventually, this will renderevery server obsolete.Holy shit.Welcome to the future, Gavin.-Whoa! Oh, no. Oh, no.-Son of a bitch!I have spoken to our top LPsto start a new firm.Would you care to jump shipwith me?You are, after all,my best friend.What?Gavin just fucked offto go find himself,who knows where.-It's the patent.He just signed overfull ownership to me.There's a loud man hereto see you.Welcome home and congratulationson getting your business back.Thank you, and I shouldcongratulate youon your breakthrough.I can help you getwhere you wanna go.I'm pretty sure I knowwhere I wanna go,and how to get there.I shall look forwardto the fight.Jesus,what the hell did he order?Oh... No! No, no, no, no.Stop! Stop it, stop it.Oh my God.These areour new offices?Richard:Yeah. Well, this isjust the lobby.We're up thereon the second floor, but yup.These are so nice.There's a fireplace.Oh! I am a suckerfor an intuitivekitchen layout.Follow me, right up here.Trust me, you're gonna love it.Gilfoyle:It's hard to believeyour pathological inabilityto make a decisionfinally paid off.Jared: Wow.Richard, well done.Dude!

Right around here.Look, guys...the priceis unbelievable.I'm just happy thatwe got to it when we didbefore anyone else.I-- I emphatically votethat we move on this now,if we all agree.I mean,we do agree, right?I cannot put thisdelicately, so--Are you fuckingkidding me, dude?You want usto work in here?This is a fuckingblack site, Richard!A black sitewould actually be better,because at leastwe'd be protectedby the Geneva Convention.This is fuckingwith my eyes.Can I get outta here?Okay, ha-- hang on.Richard, can I talk to youfor one second,please, privately?Richard: Sure.Ah!See? Plenty of outlets.Richard...what are you doing?We can easily afford a placewith windows and... airwhere you canmaintain a connectionto time and space.If-- if we spend allthat money, it's gone.Okay, don't you rememberJack Barkersquandering all our runwayfor those fancy officesor Russ Hanneman spendingnearly every cent we hadon fucking swag?I'm sorry, man,we do not get another chance.This is it.Gilfoyle:There is no point whispering.We can hearevery fucking word you sayin this sweatbox.I can hearyou gulping, Richard.No, you can't.Richard, it ismy firm opinionthat if we wereto take this space,our new hireswouldn't be coding,they would be havingpanic attacks.No, come on.I'm doing a really good jobof hiding it,but I'm having oneright now.I gotta getthe fuck outta here.Jared, you okay?I will not be back.Wait, guys, hold on.Jared, I'm gonna get yousome water, okay?Richard:Okay, what about this guy,Chris Berger?He's a very skilled engineer.He was very funnywhen we met with him.I think he'd be great.He was oddly tall,don't you think?Gilfoyle:Yeah, pass.Alright, what aboutBlake Kang?His beard hair lookedlike head hair.And his head hairlooked like beard hair.Come on! It's beena fucking month.I got us theseexpensive-ass officesbecause you wanted them,and now they're justsitting here, empty,because you guyswon't agree on anyone.Look, I'm goingto be seeingLaurie Breamat this stupid InnovationHall of Fame event tonight,and she's gonna askhow hiring is going.She's 11 months pregnantand highly irritable.What am I goingto tell her?That we've justbeen dicking aroundthe whole time?We're not dicking around.Really?What about this?Gilfoyle:Touché.He sent ina professional headshot.We had no choice.Plus his face lookslike a taint.Okay, yeah, fair.But look, I sent you63 good people.I spared you kilt guy,openly alt-right guy,obviously closetedalt-right guy,and the guywith the stupidfucking pizza app.It was so lame,it would somehowmake you hate pizza.You have to choose.Dude, it's easyfor you to say.You're gonnabe off CEO'ing,going to fancy galas.We're the ones who haveto like be in the engine roomwith these clowns.Gilfoyle:They have to meetour rigorous standards.I mean, look at the threewe've already hired.Just look at them.There they are.Stallions.Gilfoyle:Each one more magnificentthan the last.Dinesh:Perfect.Yeah, they're glorious,obviously,but that'sonly three of them,and they're luxuriating herein this huge fucking palacethat is costing us a fortune,so hurry up and pick thesefucking coders,and stop acting like a coupleof spoiled millionaires.Alright, Richard,your tuxedois pressed and readyfor the gala.I put a touch of mintin the steamer.You're gonna looklike Richard Gerefrom "Pretty Woman."Maybe tonight you'll fallfor a radiant sex worker.During my sabbaticalfrom Hooli,I touredthe wonders of the world,seeking inspirationfrom mankind'sgreatest achievements--the Parthenon,Angkor Wat,the Great Pyramidof Giza.But it wasn'tuntil my flight homethat I had my epiphany.Yes, those wondersare visited by thousandsof people every year,but 2.4 million peoplevisit HooliSearchevery minute.God, what a fucking douchebag.Gavin:And then it occurred to me.What I have built isa far greater achievement,than anyof the ancient world.And the ideal versionof myselfwas the manI already was.Thank you.Richard?Richard Hendricks.Oh. Huh? Okay.Yeah, hi, Duncan.Yeah.Me and my guys werejust talking about youand your pizza app.Oh yeah. I bet.Our algorithm finds youthe cheapest, fastest pizza,and it's-- it's awesome.Yeah.It's actually so awesome...Definitely.that-- oh man, I'm gonna--I'm gonna have to pullmy resume.Oh, you're pulling your--Oh no.Yeah, I just don't feelas psyched about itas I do about Sliceline.Sliceline?That's the nameof your app?Yeah.Oh God.Great.Yeah, it's a pun.Is it?Yeah. It rhymeswith Priceline.Okay. Just--so, it rhymes? Okay.Yeah. It's a rhyming pun.Anyway, there might besome major VCs around here,so I gotta go mingle.Okay.It's the-- it's the worst partof this job. Am I right?I'm kidding.It's the best part of the job.Okay.What an asshole.Richard.Gavin, hello.Don't you look cutein your Sunday best?How's that littlebunny Internet going?Mmm. New Internet. New.Unlike your old Internet.You know, I'm gladI ran into you, Richard.I was actuallystarting to feel badabout what I did today.OhInvent the MOSFETtransistorIt's old technology.It's very old, like you.No. I've heard thatyou're trying to staff up.Over the past few months,you've met with just aboutevery distributed systemsdeveloper in the Valley.Okay, well, not everyone.63 of them,and as of 4:30 p.m.this afternoon,I hired them,all 63 of them.Yeah, I had to paythrough the nose,but you know what?♪ ♪That look right thereon your face?It makes it worthevery penny.You know what?Enjoy the reception, Richard.You too.Jared:Yeah, he wasn't bluffing.He hired all of them.Even my boyBlake Kang?He was a good one.I'm sorry, uh, your boy?I thought his hairwas backwards?You guys were lukewarmon him and everybody elsefor all kinds of stupid reasons.Well, now that they'reunavailable, their strengthsare more readily apparent.And I don't wantto point fingers,but we wouldn't be hereif you hadn't letGilfoyle and me wasteso much time being picky.What? I was dyingto move faster.I was just respectingyour process.Our process sucks.Your inabilityto stop us from suckingis a failureof leadership.At least we stillhave the stallions.Ah. Those stallions.Look at 'em.Magnificent.Sit back down.Just sit in your chairs.Jared, um...call alt-right guyand cologne boyand all the other rejects,and... set meetings.Well, I did a little diggingon the alt-right guy,and he's pretty involvedin a campaign to eliminateblack emojis,but there mightbe another option.Do you rememberKira Pickford?Yes, actually.Yeah, good coder,but she had her own company.Well, that's true, exceptthat her company, Optimoji,just losttheir second roundof funding,so they're basicallyon life support.So?So, what if, insteadof building a team,we acquired one?Dinesh:But Optimoji has 30 people.We only need 12.Well, we'll just insistthat she let the other 18 go.We have a lot of leverage.Richard is a shrewd negotiator,and I'm, you know, spirited.Look, Kira,this is a fair offer.But... I've got30 great guys.We're like family,and you only wannabring along 12?I have to dowhat's right by my guys.Look, I know whatit's like to only be ableto rescue half your family,and it's awful,but what can you do?Shh, shh.Sometimesthere's only one--Jared, okay, stop.Um, look, Kira,you're not gonna finda better deal than that.Your companyis close to bankruptcyand we all know that thereare a lotta coders out therein this old town,and we could goto any of 'em,but we wannago to you, so...kinda feels like we've gotall the cards here, huh?Richard.You keep following me,I'm gonna callthe cops.I'm just kidding.Oh.Hey, I'm Duncan.Hey. Kira.Hey, guess what companyjust got his Series "A"Term SheetOh, the Sliceline.Congrats, yeah.Duncan: Yeah, we'restaffing up like crazy.Speaking of staffing,how about all those codersyou lost, man?I'm sorry.That must've beena real blow.What coders?Um, I'm sorry,I don't mean to be rude,but this is boring.Thank GodI didn't acceptyour offer.I'd be the only guyworking for younow that Gavin Belsonswooped inand tactically mass-hiredevery singledistributed systemsengineer you were looking at.Gavin hired allof Richard's coders?Not everyone.Not everyone.Yup. The guy is savage,and so are my guysif they don't gettheir caffeine,so nice meeting you, Kira.Cool. Cool, cool.What were you sayingabout holding all the cards?All of my codersor none of them.Take it or leave it.Dinesh:What?Gilfoyle:What the fuck?Do you have--Do you--Dinesh:Jian-Yang!Jian-Yang...would you please explainwhy we each foundsome random Chinese guyasleep in our beds?Yes, you work all day.Your rooms are always empty,so they use.The fuck they do.Yes, it's not your house.This is notyour house either,Jian-Yang.This is Erlich's house.Do you think Erlich wouldwant your guys here?No. That's why I invite them,because I hate Errich.We are not Erlich.You are from Errich'sadministration.No, we are not.Nobody has heardfrom Erlich in months.This isn't working.I'm gonna drag your cousinthe fuck outta my lair.Jian-Yang:No, this is my cousin.Engineers, welcome.You are 63 of the topdistributed systems developersin the Valley,and we're looking forwardto working with you.Hooli is the future,and your future is...the Box Two.So, are thereany questions?Yes?I'm sorry, but whatif we don't wannawork on that?Weird. This isour flagship product,but I'm sure we'dall like to hear whatyou would like to work on.A decentralized Internet,like we were going to buildwith Richard Hendricks.Actually, that's the one thingwe can't do here at Hooli. Yes?Sorry. You only hired usbecause Pied Piperwanted us, right?Untrue. Go on.And Pied Piper only wanted usbecause of our ability to helpbuild a decentralized Internet.Can't speakto that. Continue.And you're telling usthat even if we want to,we can't builda decentralizedInternet here.May I ask why not?Because Richard ownsthe patent for it.Yes, third row,red hoodie.How did he get it?I gave it to him.You in the back?Why did you do that?It was a Buddhist actof selflessness.Well, I'm also a Buddhist,and I would nevergive him the patent.I mean, once he buildsthat Internet,he's gonna renderHooli's entire web-basedecosystem completely obsolete.I mean, everythingyou're doing hereis antiquated.That's not a question.That's a statement.You know what?Fuck you guys.I don't want youworking on my box.It's too good for you."Antiquated"?Why did you alltake my money then,you entitled little pricks?You all thinkyou're John Lennonuntil someone wavesa dollar in your face!You know what?Get outta here!Go on, just wanderthe campus for four yearsuntil you vest.See what I care.I'm serious! Go! Goodbye!Thank you very much!Assholes."Antiquated"?Fuck do they think they are?I'm in the InnovationHall of Fame. Are they?Speaking of, they sent overthe official inductees portrait.You and your peers.Handsome bunch.Fuck.Fuck!So, Mr. Yang--It's Mr. Jian.In China,last name comes first.Okay. Mr. Jian,you say that Erlich Bachmanwrote this letter...to you?Yes."This is Erlich. Hello."I am gone,but Jian-Yang is a very goodfriend and very smart."I want him to bethe leader of the house"and control allof the friends.Goodbye.Bachman Erlich."Yes. I want his house.Thank you.Okay, I don't technicallyrepresent Mr. Bachman.I'm Pied Piper'scorporate counsel,so my exposure to Bachmanpertains only to his 10%ownership of the business.Errich owns 10%of Pied Piper?This was not a lie?Sadly, no,that's very, very real.That's wortha lot of money.It's promising tech.One day it could be wortha shit-ton.Shit-ton. Yes.Mr. Jian, you seemlike a good guy.Um, this letter isnot a legal document.I mean,maybe a skilled attorneycould make a casethat in the absenceof an existing will,this would serve as onein the case of Bachman's death,but as far as I can tell,the guy is not...Dead.Yes. Errich is dead.Do you happen to have...a death certificateor any-- any formof proof of--Yes.I can get it now.Richard:Our deal with Kirais for 30 fucking coders.Where in the hell arewe gonna put them?Well, I supposewe could put three moreworkstations here,and then two more over there.It'd be crowded but cozy.They'll beall holed up togetherlike the Branch Davidians.Yeah, but, I mean,are we sure this isthe right thing to do?I mean, I don't wantto crowd the stallions.Are we sure taking onall 30 of Kira's guysis the right move?We can get up and running.They all know each other,so we won't have to playthe name game.Yeah.Ron, hello.Hey, buddy.Hang on just a second.No, the-- the exit is--the exit is the other way.God damn it.Um, Richie, you knowa guy named "JeeJan? Uh, no.Well, I know a "Jan the Man,"but she's a woman.Look, did you-- did you talkto the Optimoji board yet?Uh, did we close the deal?Uh, well, a deal closed.Another bidder came inwith a better offer,so they went with them.Richard : What?Was it Gavinfucking Belson again?Ron :No, it was a new company.Real smart, clever name.Sort of a punthat rhymes.Oh, hello, dickheads.I hope I'm notinterrupting your plotting,you sneaky little dinks.Kira, you and I hada deal, okay?So fuck you, fuck you,and fuck you!Man:What did he say?Not you.Just e-- everyone.I meant fuck all of you.No one specific.Richard,you low-balled me.Mmm?Remember? Well, Duncan heresaid he wanted to growfast as balls.He said he was psyched.Yeah, I am psyched.I'd hire a million peopleif I could.See, if I haveto sell my company,I might as well sell itto the CEO whoactually wants all of us.It's pizza, Kira.Richard, we're justthree CEOs tryingto do right by our companies.Okay, you know what?I'm glad you turned us down,because I don't wantto work with anyonewho wants to workwith this... meathead.I'm taking these.I'm taking all of them.Maybe just take one.You have like four employees.Richard: Ha!Ah, shit.Gavin:Throw it away.Patrice, I'd liketo welcome you backto the Hooli family.It's wonderfulto be back, Gavin.Sadly, the timingcouldn't be worse.Those code-monkeysI just hired were rightabout one thing:Making Jack's boxthe flagship productof this companywill send us down a pathto technological irrelevancefrom whichwe will never return.But in light of the timeand resourceswe've investedin this product,convincing the boardand our shareholdersto simply scrap itwill be nearly impossible.Our company is too bigto turn around that quickly.Gavin, what if you launcheda new product to help uscorrect course?Absolutely. Look at allthe products you've broughtto market over the years.Gavin:Hmm. True.I did invent the HooliPodand the HooliPadand the HooliPad Pro,but a man only hasso many game-changinginventions in him.And technically,all the products he justnamed were money-losers.I mean, you could arguewe'd have been better offif he'd never inventedany of that stuff.Hoover.Hoover:Sir.Patrice, can I talkto you outsidefor a second?Anyway, if Jack Barker'sinsidious box is allowedto go to market,we may all lose our jobs.We may all gothe way of Patrice.But we must fight it.We cannot sacrificeour long-term wellbeingin the interest of paltry,short-term profits.Well, they'renot paltry, exactly.Did you not seethe preorder figuresfor the Box Two?They came inthis morning.Holy shit.Are these right?How many quarters is this?Just one.The Box Two will be by farthe most lucrative new productwe've ever released.Fucking Sliceline.Plus his fancy,hi-tech pizza tastesjust like Domino's.There's a reason for that.Check out the liner.Jared:Oh yeah.I guess that's Domino's.We never had pizza'cause my step-mom saidItalians aren'treal white people.Hold on. Duncan doesn'teven make his own pizza?He just orders itfrom Domino'sand switches the boxes?He really is sneaky.It's not sneaky.It's stupid.Switching boxes costsa lot of money.Okay. How do you know?I need to proveErrich's dead,so I want to shipa dead body from China,but it's hard to finda white body in China,especially fatlike Errich,so I buy a fat,white cadaverfrom Cincinnatimedical school.But to ship to China,then switch box,then ship back,it's way too much money.Say that again.Like, not one wordof that made sense.Hold on. Just-- ju--what-- uh...does anyone--does anyone knowthe price of a Domino's pizza?A large, 10 bucks.Okay, well,Sliceline sellstheirs for nine.So?So, we're not fucked yet.That waskinda crazy, Richard.That was--I mean, you threwa full-on tantrum.I know, I know.I am so sorry.It's just-- I guessI'm just a CEO tryingto do right by my company.Like you guys.Speaking of business,wow, we're having a hellof a night.Yeah, well, I would know.About 500 of those orderstonight are me.Oh. Richard,you really didn'thave to do that.But the peace offeringis super appreciated.Yeah, well,I wouldn't really call ita peace offering.You see, Duncan,you took eight milin funding, right?And then you matchedmy offer to acquireOptimoji here from Kira,but the thing is,you can't sell your pizzasfor nine bucks a popwithout taking a bath,can you?The reboxing,the double delivery, ugh.You lose, what,four bucks an order?Five, actually.We're losingfive bucks a pizza?Yeah.Only temporarily.So, her team isgonna optimizeour order routingand allocation, and thenwe'll be cash-flow positive.We can easilyturn it aroundbefore we run outof money.Right.Yeah.Unless a lot of peoplebuy your pizzavery quickly.What are--what are you doing?Well, Duncan,I can be a dickhead too.You see, I have $13 millionin my bank accountand a very low payroll,which affords me to buya lot of tasty 'zabefore you canturn it around.You're tryingto bankrupt us?No, Kira. I'm simply tryingto devalue your company,so that I can makea low-ball acquisition offerwhich you cannot refuse.Richard, I'm just gonnadelete your account.You see, my engineersalready thought of that,and they worked upa little botnet program.Thousands of fake usersindistinguishablefrom real onesgeolocated perfectlyto maximize drive timeand bleedyour little greasebagoperation dry.You know,I may not havethat many coders,but the ones I doare stallions,each one more magnificentthan the last.Monica:You spent$19,000 on pizza?No, $19,000 on vengeance.You're acquiring Slicelinewho already acquired Optimoji?Richard, you're talkingabout absorbing a staff of 50.How are you gonnaspin this to Laurie?Well, you saidyou'd protect mefrom Laurie.I mean, she's your partner.Are you afraid of her?Of courseI'm afraid of her.The woman got pregnantjust to prove to methat she could do itwithout missinga day of work.Okay, fair enough,but maybe this one timeyou could take my side.I cannot take your side.You're askingfor 50 employees.Think of the--Sorry I am late.Hey, Laurie.Did you, uh--Induce?Yes, this morning...and here I am.So, Richard,I received your email.I understand you wishto acquire a companycalled... Sliceline,which themselvesrecently acquireda company called Optimoji.Yes, and I will be firingboth companies' CEOsand taking ona total engineering teamof about, uh, 50.Fifty?Monica, you areokay with this?Well, it shortenstheir runway significantly,but you did saythat you want themto grow, Laurie.Yes, but in this caseit seems...reckless.However, if you areon top of it,Monica, then......approved.Congratulations.Great. Thanks.And congratulationsto you too.On?On the-- on your--on your baby.Oh.This is awesome.Gavin is essentiallydoubling-downon the very thingwe are destroying.It's like he's giving up.Maybe I should've orderedthe nicer Tesla.Dinesh:Ah.Oh gosh.Everyone's here.Jared: Richard.So many people.Richard.Hey. Hey.I thought you'd want to givesome opening remarks,you know, it beingthe first day and all,just to set the tone.Ladies and gentlemen,Richard Hendricks!Um...Um...Well, it's greatto have everybodyand... so many... f-- faces.We've got a lot of...men and women here.And...we should remember that.So, let's keep it clean.Um...it's always a challenge...to get it--I've got--I should probably--more to say in a minute.I just have to go, one--one second, in my office...and then we'll conclude.Uh, he just needsa second in his office,then he's gonna come back.Oh God.Don't tell anyone, okay?Um, Richard, I know--I know money's tight,but I think I might investin a modesty panelfor your desk.Richard:What?♪ Yeah ♪♪ The monkey speaks his mind ♪♪ Now, three monkeys satin a coconut tree ♪♪ Discussing thingsas they are said to be ♪♪ Said one to other,Now listen, you two ♪♪ There's a certain rumorthat can't be true ♪♪ That man descendedour noble race ♪♪ Why, the very idea ♪♪ Is a big disgrace ♪♪ And here's another thing ♪♪ You will never see ♪♪ A monkeybuilding a fence ♪♪ Around a coconut tree ♪♪ And let the coconuts ♪♪ Go to waste ♪♪ Forbidding allthe monkeys ♪♪ To come and taste ♪You have petitionedto become the sole executorof the estate of Erlich Bachman.Erlich Bachman is dead.Oh!The Optimoji guysand the Sliceline guys,they are united against me.Good news.
