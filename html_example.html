I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh! Hey there, buddy.<br><br>MONICA: Hello.<br><br>- Who's this? Another board member'?<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>(AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE)<br>Aspen, it's time for bed.<br><br>I don't want to go to bed.<br><br>I'm sorry, buddy. It's not up to me.<br><br>- I need you to cooperate, Aspen.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...<br><br>Fine.<br><br>...four, three... Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it! Jian Yang!<br><br>

Jared, what do you think?<br><br>Well, he's qualified<br>and he definitely seemed interested.<br><br>It's a programmer's market right now.<br><br>I think if we like him,<br>we should pursue him aggressively.<br><br>My only concern here, and it's a small one,<br>um, he's also named Jared.<br><br>Will it be confusing with mo Jareds?<br><br>If we hire him,<br>I can always go back to my real name, Donald.<br><br>No, that's too big a hassle.<br>We'll just go with Other Jared.<br><br>OJ, for short.<br><br>I know a name is just a sound<br>somebody makes when they need you,<br><br>but shouldn't this much-newer Jared<br>be Other Jared?<br><br>You should be flattered.<br><br>O.J.

And he wanted you to know<br><br>that he moved four school-aged children<br>and his elderly mother across the country<br><br>in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.<br><br>He was very clear about that.<br><br>And he wanted me to convey that to you.<br><br>Have I done that?<br><br>Yeah. So, what is my job exactly?<br><br>Well, that's actually... That's up to you.<br>You can do whatever you want.<br><br>Okay. See, that's sort of<br>what I do now, though.<br><br>But starting today, you can do it<br>in a much more significant way.<br><br>So, enjoy your new office.<br><br>Wait, this is my office?<br><br>Sorry to interrupt. The photographers here.<br><br>Photographer'?<br><br>From WIRED magazine,<br>for the profile they're doing on you.<br><br>Sorry, who are you?<br><br>Your assistant.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.<br><br>Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone<br>you guys recommended I contact,<br><br>Carla Walton?<br><br>Yeah, we hung outwith her a bunch<br>at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.<br><br>Her code is fucking great.<br><br>She was head of engineering at EarCast?<br><br>She was engineering at EarCast.<br>She built that whole system on her own.<br><br>You know what else excites me here?<br><br>There's a distinct over-representation of men<br>in this company. Look around.<br><br>I think it would behoove us<br>to prioritize hiring a woman.<br><br>I disagree, OJ.<br><br>We should hire<br>the best person for the job, period.<br><br>And Carla is one of the best.<br><br>Right, let me rephrase.<br><br>I think having a woman in the company<br>is important,<br><br>but hiring someone<br>only because they're a woman is bad.<br><br>I would never compromise Pied Piper.<br><br>Okay, just 10 be clear,<br><br>our top priority is to hire<br>the most qualified person available, right?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>But it would be better<br>if that someone was a woman<br><br>even though the "woman" part<br>of that statement is irrelevant?<br><br>Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles<br>and now we just need Yoko.<br><br>That's the worst example<br>you could have used.<br><br>I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using<br>WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.<br><br>So, basically,<br>I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream<br><br>and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.<br><br>The users pay for all that bandwidth,<br>not you? Wow.<br><br>That could save us a ton of money.<br><br>Yeah, a shit ton.<br><br>And do you think you could integrate it<br>into our platform by January in time for CES?<br><br>Look, I'm not going to get in your way.<br><br>You know, you design the engine.<br>I just assemble the car.<br><br>I could have an alpha of that up<br>in a solid weekend of hacking.<br><br>Wow. Cool.<br><br>Plus, I could count on one hand<br>the number of people on Earth<br><br>who could handle sitting in a room<br>with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...<br><br>All of that.<br><br>Plus, you're a woman.<br><br>What?<br><br>No, I just mean we would absolutely love<br>to have a strong woman working here.<br><br>I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh!

Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity?

Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous.

So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!

And he wanted you to know<br><br>that he moved four school-aged children<br>and his elderly mother across the country<br><br>in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.<br><br>He was very clear about that.<br><br>And he wanted me to convey that to you.<br><br>Have I done that?<br><br>Yeah. So, what is my job exactly?<br><br>Well, that's actually... That's up to you.<br>You can do whatever you want.<br><br>Okay. See, that's sort of<br>what I do now, though.<br><br>But starting today, you can do it<br>in a much more significant way.<br><br>So, enjoy your new office.<br><br>Wait, this is my office?<br><br>Sorry to interrupt. The photographers here.<br><br>Photographer'?<br><br>From WIRED magazine,<br>for the profile they're doing on you.<br><br>Sorry, who are you?<br><br>Your assistant.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.<br><br>Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone<br>you guys recommended I contact,<br><br>Carla Walton?<br><br>Yeah, we hung outwith her a bunch<br>at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.<br><br>Her code is fucking great.<br><br>She was head of engineering at EarCast?<br><br>She was engineering at EarCast.<br>She built that whole system on her own.<br><br>You know what else excites me here?<br><br>There's a distinct over-representation of men<br>in this company. Look around.<br><br>I think it would behoove us<br>to prioritize hiring a woman.<br><br>I disagree, OJ.<br><br>We should hire<br>the best person for the job, period.<br><br>And Carla is one of the best.<br><br>Right, let me rephrase.<br><br>I think having a woman in the company<br>is important,<br><br>but hiring someone<br>only because they're a woman is bad.<br><br>I would never compromise Pied Piper.<br><br>Okay, just 10 be clear,<br><br>our top priority is to hire<br>the most qualified person available, right?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>But it would be better<br>if that someone was a woman<br><br>even though the "woman" part<br>of that statement is irrelevant?<br><br>Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles<br>and now we just need Yoko.<br><br>That's the worst example<br>you could have used.<br><br>I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using<br>WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.<br><br>So, basically,<br>I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream<br><br>and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.<br><br>The users pay for all that bandwidth,<br>not you? Wow.<br><br>That could save us a ton of money.<br><br>Yeah, a shit ton.<br><br>And do you think you could integrate it<br>into our platform by January in time for CES?<br><br>Look, I'm not going to get in your way.<br><br>You know, you design the engine.<br>I just assemble the car.<br><br>I could have an alpha of that up<br>in a solid weekend of hacking.<br><br>Wow. Cool.<br><br>Plus, I could count on one hand<br>the number of people on Earth<br><br>who could handle sitting in a room<br>with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...<br><br>All of that.<br><br>Plus, you're a woman.<br><br>What?<br><br>No, I just mean we would absolutely love<br>to have a strong woman working here.<br><br>I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh! Hey there, buddy.<br><br>MONICA: Hello.<br><br>- Who's this? Another board member'?<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>(AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE)<br>Aspen, it's time for bed.<br><br>I don't want to go to bed.<br><br>I'm sorry, buddy. It's not up to me.<br><br>- I need you to cooperate, Aspen.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...<br><br>Fine.<br><br>...four, three... Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!

Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I...

Jared, what do you think?<br><br>Well, he's qualified<br>and he definitely seemed interested.<br><br>It's a programmer's market right now.<br><br>I think if we like him,<br>we should pursue him aggressively.<br><br>My only concern here, and it's a small one,<br>um, he's also named Jared.<br><br>Will it be confusing with mo Jareds?<br><br>If we hire him,<br>I can always go back to my real name, Donald.<br><br>No, that's too big a hassle.<br>We'll just go with Other Jared.<br><br>OJ, for short.<br><br>I know a name is just a sound<br>somebody makes when they need you,<br><br>but shouldn't this much-newer Jared<br>be Other Jared?<br><br>You should be flattered.<br><br>O.J.

And he wanted you to know<br><br>that he moved four school-aged children<br>and his elderly mother across the country<br><br>in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.<br><br>He was very clear about that.<br><br>And he wanted me to convey that to you.<br><br>Have I done that?<br><br>Yeah. So, what is my job exactly?<br><br>Well, that's actually... That's up to you.<br>You can do whatever you want.<br><br>Okay. See, that's sort of<br>what I do now, though.<br><br>But starting today, you can do it<br>in a much more significant way.<br><br>So, enjoy your new office.<br><br>Wait, this is my office?<br><br>Sorry to interrupt. The photographers here.<br><br>Photographer'?<br><br>From WIRED magazine,<br>for the profile they're doing on you.<br><br>Sorry, who are you?<br><br>Your assistant.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.<br><br>Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone<br>you guys recommended I contact,<br><br>Carla Walton?<br><br>Yeah, we hung outwith her a bunch<br>at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.<br><br>Her code is fucking great.<br><br>She was head of engineering at EarCast?<br><br>She was engineering at EarCast.<br>She built that whole system on her own.<br><br>You know what else excites me here?<br><br>There's a distinct over-representation of men<br>in this company. Look around.<br><br>I think it would behoove us<br>to prioritize hiring a woman.<br><br>I disagree, OJ.<br><br>We should hire<br>the best person for the job, period.<br><br>And Carla is one of the best.<br><br>Right, let me rephrase.<br><br>I think having a woman in the company<br>is important,<br><br>but hiring someone<br>only because they're a woman is bad.<br><br>I would never compromise Pied Piper.<br><br>Okay, just 10 be clear,<br><br>our top priority is to hire<br>the most qualified person available, right?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>But it would be better<br>if that someone was a woman<br><br>even though the "woman" part<br>of that statement is irrelevant?<br><br>Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles<br>and now we just need Yoko.<br><br>That's the worst example<br>you could have used.<br><br>I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using<br>WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.<br><br>So, basically,<br>I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream<br><br>and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.<br><br>The users pay for all that bandwidth,<br>not you? Wow.<br><br>That could save us a ton of money.<br><br>Yeah, a shit ton.<br><br>And do you think you could integrate it<br>into our platform by January in time for CES?<br><br>Look, I'm not going to get in your way.<br><br>You know, you design the engine.<br>I just assemble the car.<br><br>I could have an alpha of that up<br>in a solid weekend of hacking.<br><br>Wow. Cool.<br><br>Plus, I could count on one hand<br>the number of people on Earth<br><br>who could handle sitting in a room<br>with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...<br><br>All of that.<br><br>Plus, you're a woman.<br><br>What?<br><br>No, I just mean we would absolutely love<br>to have a strong woman working here.<br><br>I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh!

Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity?

Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three?

But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat.

Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!

As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it! Jian Yang!<br><br>

I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no.

So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months.

        Thanks for coming in
<br>
and sitting down with us.
<br>
<br>
We're really excited to meet a few
<br>
good engineers to join the Pied Piper team.
<br>
<br>
So, why don't you tell us
<br>
a little about yourself?
<br>
<br>
I don't work before noon.
<br>
<br>
Or after 2:00 p.m.
<br>
<br>
And I need to bring my dog to work.
<br>
Are you dog-friendly?
<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, you can bring your clog to work.
<br>
<br>
That's not what I asked.
<br>
Are you dog-friendly?
<br>
<br>
Um...
<br>
<br>
Nice pool. Can my dog go in?
<br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah, we're very dog-friendly.
<br>

<br>
Is there a lifeguard?
<br>
<br>
Um...
<br>
<br>
'Cause my dog can't swim.
<br>
<br>
Now, it says here on your résumé that
<br>
from 2010 to 2011, you "crushed it"?
<br>
<br>
That's actually an old résumé.
<br>
<br>
It should also read
<br>
that I crushed it from 2013 to present.
<br>
<br>
So, are we to understand
<br>
that you did not "crush it" in 2012?
<br>
<br>
There was a medical situation preventing me
<br>
from crushing it to my usual standards.
<br>
<br>
So, I had to take some time off
<br>
until I was able to crush it at 100%,
<br>
<br>
at which point I resumed crushing it full-time.
<br>
<br>
So, it says here that you're proficient in C++,
<br>
<br>
code assembly
<br>
for multiple processor architectures,
<br>
<br>
and that you are a cyborg?
<br>
<br>
That is correct. Short for cybernetic organism.

I came into this world of filth and pain
<br>
with a congenital heart condition,
<br>
<br>
requiring the installation of a pacemaker,
<br>
upon which I am mortally dependent.
<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Mmm.
<br>
<br>
Wow. He's technically a cyborg.
<br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah. Makes the résumé accurate.
<br>
<br>
Look, we all know
<br>
that I can make a shitload more money
<br>
<br>
working for some multi-colored Happy Town
<br>
in a hermetically-sealed box.
<br>
<br>
But permission to be honest?
<br>
<br>
Permission granted.
<br>
<br>
Granted.
<br>
<br>
I like that you guys are so weird.
<br>
<br>
Hmm.
<br>
<br>
Yes, we are the weird ones.
<br>
<br>
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
<br>
<br>
This morning'
<br>
you put your soda cans in the green one.
<br>
<br>
Okay? That's not right.
<br>
<br>
The green is for grass and leaves.
<br>
<br>
Okay?
<br>
<br>
The blue one is for recycling.
<br>
<br>
Go ahead and put those in there.
<br>
<br>
Yeah.
<br>
<br>
Very good.
<br>
The black one is for all other trash.
<br>
<br>
Do you understand?
<br>
<br>
Yes. Which is for burning?
<br>
<br>
No, we don't burn trash in this country.
<br>
It's illegal.
<br>
<br>
You never burn trash.
<br>
<br>
Okay, can you say that? "I never burn trash."
<br>
<br>
- I never burn trash.
<br>
- Yes.
<br>
<br>
What about garbage?
<br>
<br>
(DOOR OPENS)
<br>
<br>
(DOOR CLOSES)
<br>
<br>
Motherfucker.
<br>
<br>
Jared Patakian?
<br>
<br>
(SIGHS)
<br>
<br>
You know' this Patakian guy
<br>
is definitely on some end of some spectrum,
<br>
<br>
but he is a full-stack engineer.
<br>
<br>
I mean, I'm sold. Jared, what do you think?
<br>
<br>
Well, he's qualified
<br>
and he definitely seemed interested.
<br>
<br>
It's a programmer's market right now.
<br>
<br>
I think if we like him,
<br>
we should pursue him aggressively.
<br>
<br>
My only concern here, and it's a small one,
<br>
um, he's also named Jared.
<br>
<br>
Will it be confusing with mo Jareds?
<br>
<br>
If we hire him,
<br>
I can always go back to my real name, Donald.
<br>
<br>
No, that's too big a hassle.
<br>
We'll just go with Other Jared.
<br>
<br>
OJ, for short.
<br>
<br>
I know a name is just a sound
<br>
somebody makes when they need you,
<br>
<br>
but shouldn't this much-newer Jared
<br>
be Other Jared?
<br>
<br>
You should be flattered.
<br>
<br>
O.J. Simpson is one of the most
<br>
recognizable people on the face of the planet.
<br>
<br>
Was that Jared Patakian
<br>
I saw exiting the house?
<br>
<br>
Yes, we just interviewed him.
<br>
We think he's great.
<br>
<br>
He actually is great.
<br>
I tried to hire him for Aviato.
<br>
<br>
But then he took the offer,
<br>
shopped it around town,
<br>
<br>
and got more dough at a different gig.
<br>
<br>
I didn't care for the way that he handled it.
<br>
<br>
So, lam going to have to err
<br>
on the side of caution and say, "Pass-adena,"
<br>
<br>
Trina.
<br>
<br>
Well, I'm sorry that that happened to you,
<br>
but you don't get to Pass-adena on anyone.
<br>
<br>
We've got to hire a lot of people,
<br>
and he was the only one that we all agree on.
<br>
<br>
But this is my house.
<br>
I'm on the board of this company.
<br>
<br>
I mean, I must get dings, right?
<br>
<br>
- Dings?
<br>
- Like in a jury or Whose Line is h' Anyway?
<br>
<br>
Erlich, thank you
<br>
for letting us stay in your house
<br>
<br>
while we figure out
<br>
what we need office-wise. Really.
<br>
<br>
But I'm sorry. You don't get a say in this.
<br>
<br>
We're going to hire the android.
<br>
<br>
ERLICH: He's a cyborg, Richard.
<br>
<br>
The son of a bitch is a goddamned cyborg.
<br>
<br>
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
<br>
distinguished guests Question.
<br>
<br>
What is a moonshot?
<br>
<br>
A moonshot is an idea so big,
<br>
so bold as to be impossible.
<br>
<br>
Until I! is not.
<br>
<br>
Magellan circumnavigating...
<br>
<br>
(WHISPERING) There you are.
<br>
<br>
Oh, sorry, I got lost.
<br>
But I think I'm supposed to be here...
<br>
<br>
(SHUSHING) Come on.
<br>
<br>
Not so long ago, people called the idea
<br>
of sending a man to the Moon a moonshot.
<br>
<br>
But we did it, and that is just the beginning;.
<br>
<br>
No idea will be too big
<br>
for our newest division, Hooli XYZ.
<br>
<br>
How long do I have to stay here?
<br>
'Cause lunch...
<br>
<br>
Shh...
<br>
<br>
And today, I'm pleased to announce
<br>
that after some negotiations and arm-twisting,
<br>
<br>
the brilliant Professor Davis Bannerchek,
<br>
<br>
a pioneer in robotics
<br>
and founder of Somerville Dynamics,
<br>
<br>
has agreed to head up this new division.
<br>
<br>
I give you Dr. Bannerchek,
<br>
<br>
he one and only man
<br>
{it to be the first head dreamer of Hooli XYZ.
<br>
<br>
Also, I give you the one and only man
<br>
fit to be his co-head dreamer,
<br>
<br>
our very own Nelson Bighetti,
<br>
otherwise known around here as Baghead.
<br>
<br>
- Come on up here, Baghead.
<br>
What?
<br>
<br>
He also co-founded Pied Piper
<br>
right here at Hooli.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I understand.
<br>
<br>
You are being promoted.
<br>
<br>
Being named co-head dreamer
<br>
carries with it a significant pay increase,
<br>
<br>
greater equity,
<br>
more favorable vesting schedule.
<br>
<br>
See, but I really like the job I had.
<br>
<br>
You know, I was perfectly happy there.
<br>
<br>
It was kind of the perfect level
<br>
of involvement for me, I think.
<br>
<br>
And also' that other guy, Bannerchek,
<br>
he did not really seem to like me very much.
<br>
<br>
Oh, he does not. And he wanted you to know
<br>
<br>
that he moved four school-aged children

Jared, what do you think?<br><br>Well, he's qualified<br>and he definitely seemed interested.<br><br>It's a programmer's market right now.<br><br>I think if we like him,<br>we should pursue him aggressively.<br><br>My only concern here, and it's a small one,<br>um, he's also named Jared.<br><br>Will it be confusing with mo Jareds?<br><br>If we hire him,<br>I can always go back to my real name, Donald.<br><br>No, that's too big a hassle.<br>We'll just go with Other Jared.<br><br>OJ, for short.<br><br>I know a name is just a sound<br>somebody makes when they need you,<br><br>but shouldn't this much-newer Jared<br>be Other Jared?<br><br>You should be flattered.<br><br>O.J.

And he wanted you to know<br><br>that he moved four school-aged children<br>and his elderly mother across the country<br><br>in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.<br><br>He was very clear about that.<br><br>And he wanted me to convey that to you.<br><br>Have I done that?<br><br>Yeah. So, what is my job exactly?<br><br>Well, that's actually... That's up to you.<br>You can do whatever you want.<br><br>Okay. See, that's sort of<br>what I do now, though.<br><br>But starting today, you can do it<br>in a much more significant way.<br><br>So, enjoy your new office.<br><br>Wait, this is my office?<br><br>Sorry to interrupt. The photographers here.<br><br>Photographer'?<br><br>From WIRED magazine,<br>for the profile they're doing on you.<br><br>Sorry, who are you?<br><br>Your assistant.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.<br><br>Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone<br>you guys recommended I contact,<br><br>Carla Walton?<br><br>Yeah, we hung outwith her a bunch<br>at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.<br><br>Her code is fucking great.<br><br>She was head of engineering at EarCast?<br><br>She was engineering at EarCast.<br>She built that whole system on her own.<br><br>You know what else excites me here?<br><br>There's a distinct over-representation of men<br>in this company. Look around.<br><br>I think it would behoove us<br>to prioritize hiring a woman.<br><br>I disagree, OJ.<br><br>We should hire<br>the best person for the job, period.<br><br>And Carla is one of the best.<br><br>Right, let me rephrase.<br><br>I think having a woman in the company<br>is important,<br><br>but hiring someone<br>only because they're a woman is bad.<br><br>I would never compromise Pied Piper.<br><br>Okay, just 10 be clear,<br><br>our top priority is to hire<br>the most qualified person available, right?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>But it would be better<br>if that someone was a woman<br><br>even though the "woman" part<br>of that statement is irrelevant?<br><br>Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles<br>and now we just need Yoko.<br><br>That's the worst example<br>you could have used.<br><br>I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using<br>WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.<br><br>So, basically,<br>I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream<br><br>and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.<br><br>The users pay for all that bandwidth,<br>not you? Wow.<br><br>That could save us a ton of money.<br><br>Yeah, a shit ton.<br><br>And do you think you could integrate it<br>into our platform by January in time for CES?<br><br>Look, I'm not going to get in your way.<br><br>You know, you design the engine.<br>I just assemble the car.<br><br>I could have an alpha of that up<br>in a solid weekend of hacking.<br><br>Wow. Cool.<br><br>Plus, I could count on one hand<br>the number of people on Earth<br><br>who could handle sitting in a room<br>with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...<br><br>All of that.<br><br>Plus, you're a woman.<br><br>What?<br><br>No, I just mean we would absolutely love<br>to have a strong woman working here.<br><br>I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh!

Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity?

Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous.

How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!

And he wanted you to know<br><br>that he moved four school-aged children<br>and his elderly mother across the country<br><br>in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.<br><br>He was very clear about that.<br><br>And he wanted me to convey that to you.<br><br>Have I done that?<br><br>Yeah.

See, that's sort of<br>what I do now, though.<br><br>But starting today, you can do it<br>in a much more significant way.<br><br>So, enjoy your new office.<br><br>Wait, this is my office?<br><br>Sorry to interrupt. The photographers here.<br><br>Photographer'?<br><br>From WIRED magazine,<br>for the profile they're doing on you.<br><br>Sorry, who are you?<br><br>Your assistant.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.<br><br>Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone<br>you guys recommended I contact,<br><br>Carla Walton?<br><br>Yeah, we hung outwith her a bunch<br>at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.<br><br>Her code is fucking great.<br><br>She was head of engineering at EarCast?<br><br>She was engineering at EarCast.<br>She built that whole system on her own.<br><br>You know what else excites me here?<br><br>There's a distinct over-representation of men<br>in this company. Look around.<br><br>I think it would behoove us<br>to prioritize hiring a woman.<br><br>I disagree, OJ.<br><br>We should hire<br>the best person for the job, period.<br><br>And Carla is one of the best.<br><br>Right, let me rephrase.<br><br>I think having a woman in the company<br>is important,<br><br>but hiring someone<br>only because they're a woman is bad.<br><br>I would never compromise Pied Piper.<br><br>Okay, just 10 be clear,<br><br>our top priority is to hire<br>the most qualified person available, right?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>But it would be better<br>if that someone was a woman<br><br>even though the "woman" part<br>of that statement is irrelevant?<br><br>Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles<br>and now we just need Yoko.<br><br>That's the worst example<br>you could have used.<br><br>I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using<br>WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.<br><br>So, basically,<br>I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream<br><br>and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.<br><br>The users pay for all that bandwidth,<br>not you?

So...<br><br>All of that.<br><br>Plus, you're a woman.<br><br>What?<br><br>No, I just mean we would absolutely love<br>to have a strong woman working here.<br><br>I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh...

All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool.

Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!

As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it! Jian Yang!<br><br>

I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh! Hey there, buddy.<br><br>MONICA: Hello.<br><br>- Who's this? Another board member'?<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>(AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE)<br>Aspen, it's time for bed.<br><br>I don't want to go to bed.<br><br>I'm sorry, buddy. It's not up to me.<br><br>- I need you to cooperate, Aspen.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...<br><br>Fine.<br><br>...four, three... Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it! Jian Yang!<br><br>

The photographers here.<br><br>Photographer'?<br><br>From WIRED magazine,<br>for the profile they're doing on you.<br><br>Sorry, who are you?<br><br>Your assistant.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.<br><br>Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone<br>you guys recommended I contact,<br><br>Carla Walton?<br><br>Yeah, we hung outwith her a bunch<br>at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.<br><br>Her code is fucking great.<br><br>She was head of engineering at EarCast?<br><br>She was engineering at EarCast.<br>She built that whole system on her own.<br><br>You know what else excites me here?<br><br>There's a distinct over-representation of men<br>in this company. Look around.<br><br>I think it would behoove us<br>to prioritize hiring a woman.<br><br>I disagree, OJ.<br><br>We should hire<br>the best person for the job, period.<br><br>And Carla is one of the best.<br><br>Right, let me rephrase.<br><br>I think having a woman in the company<br>is important,<br><br>but hiring someone<br>only because they're a woman is bad.<br><br>I would never compromise Pied Piper.<br><br>Okay, just 10 be clear,<br><br>our top priority is to hire<br>the most qualified person available, right?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>But it would be better<br>if that someone was a woman<br><br>even though the "woman" part<br>of that statement is irrelevant?<br><br>Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles<br>and now we just need Yoko.<br><br>That's the worst example<br>you could have used.<br><br>I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using<br>WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.<br><br>So, basically,<br>I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream<br><br>and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.<br><br>The users pay for all that bandwidth,<br>not you? Wow.<br><br>That could save us a ton of money.<br><br>Yeah, a shit ton.<br><br>And do you think you could integrate it<br>into our platform by January in time for CES?<br><br>Look, I'm not going to get in your way.<br><br>You know, you design the engine.<br>I just assemble the car.<br><br>I could have an alpha of that up<br>in a solid weekend of hacking.<br><br>Wow. Cool.<br><br>Plus, I could count on one hand<br>the number of people on Earth<br><br>who could handle sitting in a room<br>with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...<br><br>All of that.<br><br>Plus, you're a woman.<br><br>What?<br><br>No, I just mean we would absolutely love<br>to have a strong woman working here.<br><br>I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh! Hey there, buddy.<br><br>MONICA: Hello.<br><br>- Who's this? Another board member'?<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>(AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE)<br>Aspen, it's time for bed.<br><br>I don't want to go to bed.<br><br>I'm sorry, buddy. It's not up to me.<br><br>- I need you to cooperate, Aspen.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...<br><br>Fine.<br><br>...four, three... Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!

As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.<br><br>Gonna be a lot of members<br>of the three-comma club there. Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure<br>she's making less than me.<br><br>Hey, how do we find out<br>how much she's getting paid here?<br><br>I have a plan.<br><br>Hey, Carla,<br>how much money do you make here?<br><br>Uh, Let's just say<br>it's a big jump from my old job.<br><br>Right, but you probably<br>got more equity there.<br><br>Um, no, actually I get more equity here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?<br><br>Three points each.<br><br>Three? That's weird.<br>I thought you got in at the beginning.<br><br>I have another plan.<br><br>ERLICH: All right, Jian Yang,<br>don't talk to anybody else.<br><br>When we get inside, don't talk to me.<br><br>- Good evening.<br>- Here's the...<br><br>- WOMAN: Thank you.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>(DEVICE BEEPS)<br><br>And how will you be paying, sir?<br><br>- Excuse me?<br>- Your donation.<br><br>What's your preferred method of payment?<br><br>Oh...<br><br>No, these are already paid for.<br>We're guests of Russ Hanneman.<br><br>Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,<br>but you have to pay for them.<br><br>Oh. Uh...<br><br>Okay. And how much are they?<br><br>$25,000.<br><br>Um... So... But for both?<br><br>No, no, no, per ticket.<br><br>There's no possible way that<br>we could pay that, so what do we do here?<br><br>Well, there are a number of other ways<br>to help preserve the Muir Woods.<br><br>We do a volunteer clean-up program<br>every weekend.<br><br>Yeah, I don't give a shit<br>about the Muir Woods.<br><br>I need to get in there.<br><br>Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,<br>I really don't see how that's possible.<br><br>What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?<br><br>I just go in there, 10 minutes,<br>you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.<br><br>- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.<br>- Yes, I'm hungry.<br><br>Gentlemen, I'm going to need you<br>to move aside for the other guests.<br><br>You want me to email<br>Russ Hanneman right now?<br><br>You don't have Ruse's email.<br><br>But I have his... I have the phone number<br>of the person who works in his office.<br><br>Does anybody have an extra ticket?<br>My investor cannot pay.<br><br>That's actually not true. Uh...<br>I think they must have misplaced the tickets.<br><br>No, we have everyone's tickets here.<br><br>Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?<br><br>E-R-I-C-H...<br><br>That's not at all how it's spelled here.<br><br>All right. Let's go, Jian.<br><br>Have a nice night. Thank you.<br><br>- Let's go. Come on. Come on.<br>- WOMAN: Next.<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Excuse me...<br>ERLICH: Come on. Let's go.<br><br>-...do you have a ticket?<br>- ERLICH: God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!<br><br>JIAN-YANG: Do you have a ticket?<br><br>Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?<br><br>It was sad.<br><br>Erlich, he promised me dinner<br>with a big meet.<br><br>Big meat?<br><br>- Big meet people.<br>- Meat people?<br><br>Then people say, "No, you can't come in."<br><br>Wait, so you guys didn't get in?<br><br>We went to Taco Bell.<br><br>Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.<br><br>He tried to blame the taco sauce.<br><br>CARLA: Richard'?<br>RICHARD: Yes.<br><br>- OJ says you wanted to see me'?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>I don't want to say this, any of this, at all,<br><br>but several employees<br>have lodged a complaint against you.<br><br>For what?<br><br>Um...<br><br>For making this a hostile workplace.<br><br>By, quote,<br>"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces<br><br>"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy<br>who gave a new hire more than us."<br><br>CARLA: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>And which two of the several<br>lodged a complaint?<br><br>Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,<br>so I can't tell you that.<br><br>Look, you and I both know<br>how much you make.<br><br>- Are you fucking with them?<br>- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.<br><br>I bought a fake Dolce &amp; Gabbana bag<br>at a swap meet to piss them off<br><br>and apparently it did.<br><br>And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.<br><br>I also left a fake credit-card statement open<br>on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.<br><br>- Did they see it?<br>- They saw it.<br><br>- Yeah, sweet.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Carla.<br>- Okay, all right.<br><br>But what I used to do to fuck with them<br>involved gay porn and Photoshop,<br><br>so I don't think that would be cool<br>after OJ's big harassment speech.<br><br>Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...<br><br>What?<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Where?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...<br><br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br>Metal-dick piece of shit.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>He took another job<br><br>from Russ fucking Hanneman.<br><br>- What?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Apparently, I said so much<br>nice shit about him in the board meeting,<br><br>Russ offered him a job atone of his other<br>fucking companies for a lot more money.<br><br>Our own investor poached him.<br><br>And he went? Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!

Jared, what do you think?<br><br>Well, he's qualified<br>and he definitely seemed interested.<br><br>It's a programmer's market right now.<br><br>I think if we like him,<br>we should pursue him aggressively.<br><br>My only concern here, and it's a small one,<br>um, he's also named Jared.<br><br>Will it be confusing with mo Jareds?<br><br>If we hire him,<br>I can always go back to my real name, Donald.<br><br>No, that's too big a hassle.<br>We'll just go with Other Jared.<br><br>OJ, for short.<br><br>I know a name is just a sound<br>somebody makes when they need you,<br><br>but shouldn't this much-newer Jared<br>be Other Jared?<br><br>You should be flattered.<br><br>O.J.

And he wanted you to know<br><br>that he moved four school-aged children<br>and his elderly mother across the country<br><br>in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.<br><br>He was very clear about that.<br><br>And he wanted me to convey that to you.<br><br>Have I done that?<br><br>Yeah. So, what is my job exactly?<br><br>Well, that's actually... That's up to you.<br>You can do whatever you want.<br><br>Okay. See, that's sort of<br>what I do now, though.<br><br>But starting today, you can do it<br>in a much more significant way.<br><br>So, enjoy your new office.<br><br>Wait, this is my office?<br><br>Sorry to interrupt. The photographers here.<br><br>Photographer'?<br><br>From WIRED magazine,<br>for the profile they're doing on you.<br><br>Sorry, who are you?<br><br>Your assistant.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.<br><br>Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone<br>you guys recommended I contact,<br><br>Carla Walton?<br><br>Yeah, we hung outwith her a bunch<br>at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.<br><br>Her code is fucking great.<br><br>She was head of engineering at EarCast?<br><br>She was engineering at EarCast.<br>She built that whole system on her own.<br><br>You know what else excites me here?<br><br>There's a distinct over-representation of men<br>in this company. Look around.<br><br>I think it would behoove us<br>to prioritize hiring a woman.<br><br>I disagree, OJ.<br><br>We should hire<br>the best person for the job, period.<br><br>And Carla is one of the best.<br><br>Right, let me rephrase.<br><br>I think having a woman in the company<br>is important,<br><br>but hiring someone<br>only because they're a woman is bad.<br><br>I would never compromise Pied Piper.<br><br>Okay, just 10 be clear,<br><br>our top priority is to hire<br>the most qualified person available, right?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>But it would be better<br>if that someone was a woman<br><br>even though the "woman" part<br>of that statement is irrelevant?<br><br>Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles<br>and now we just need Yoko.<br><br>That's the worst example<br>you could have used.<br><br>I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using<br>WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.<br><br>So, basically,<br>I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream<br><br>and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.<br><br>The users pay for all that bandwidth,<br>not you? Wow.<br><br>That could save us a ton of money.<br><br>Yeah, a shit ton.<br><br>And do you think you could integrate it<br>into our platform by January in time for CES?<br><br>Look, I'm not going to get in your way.<br><br>You know, you design the engine.<br>I just assemble the car.<br><br>I could have an alpha of that up<br>in a solid weekend of hacking.<br><br>Wow. Cool.<br><br>Plus, I could count on one hand<br>the number of people on Earth<br><br>who could handle sitting in a room<br>with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...<br><br>All of that.<br><br>Plus, you're a woman.<br><br>What?<br><br>No, I just mean we would absolutely love<br>to have a strong woman working here.<br><br>I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.<br><br>- Don't, don't, don't.<br>- Okay, no, no.<br><br>Oh, no, yes, of course.<br><br>We want to hire the best people<br>who happen to be women,<br><br>regardless of whether or not they are women.<br><br>That part is irrelevant.<br><br>Are you doing that interviewing thing<br><br>where you try to rattle somebody<br>to see if they freak out or not?<br><br>Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.<br><br>I wouldn't know how to do that.<br><br>Well, I am aggressively<br>unemployed right now.<br><br>So, why don't you give me a call<br>when you know what you want to do?<br><br>- Great.<br>- All right.<br><br>Great. All right, I'll show you out.<br><br>Oh, lucky me.<br><br>JARED: I loved<br>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br><br>So?<br><br>So, she's actually bad-ass.<br><br>DINESH: Yeah, we told you, right?<br><br>We have to hire that person.<br><br>ERLICH: Are you shitting me?<br><br>You see this, Richard? What is this?<br><br>A spoon?<br><br>It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type<br>that is left in this drawer.<br><br>(CLATTERING)<br><br>I specifically posted a note<br>on the refrigerator saying<br><br>that the more narrow spoons be reserved<br>for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>The angle's all wrong.<br><br>Aren't you supposed<br>to just tip that little plastic cup part up<br><br>and dump the jam into the yogurt?<br><br>How would you know that?<br>Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?<br><br>No, I saw it on the billboards.<br><br>Well, what they don't tell<br>you on the billboards<br><br>is that you can't get all of it out.<br><br>Look at that! You have to dig it out.<br><br>But you can't dig it outwith these big-as-hell,<br>wide fucking spoons.<br><br>This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?<br><br>This is about Jared Patakian.<br><br>This is about me not letting you tell me<br>who I can or can't hire.<br><br>Or maybe it's about the fact that you're<br>the one who's been using my narrow spoons?<br><br>DINESHZ Okay.<br><br>You and I both have to get ready<br>for a board meeting.<br><br>Can we just stop with the nonsense?<br><br>- Nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- This is nonsense?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused<br><br>because one quarter of the jam<br>can't come out.<br><br>MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<br>You have a lovely home.<br><br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>ERLICH: I like this painting.<br><br>Is it sperm?<br><br>No, three commas.<br><br>Know what has three commas in it, Richard?<br><br>Uh... A sentence with two<br>appositive phrases in it?<br><br>No, a billion dollars.<br><br>Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.<br><br>You know, you play your cards right,<br>you could be in the three-comma club, too.<br><br>But probably not. But you could be.<br>But probably not.<br><br>There she is.<br><br>Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,<br>my girlfriend Nastia.<br><br>Charmed.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>You are Jew.<br><br>Episcopalian, actually.<br><br>Jew, good at business.<br><br>RUSS: My baby's got some ideas about Jews,<br><br>some good, some bad.<br><br>- Cool, cool.<br>- Dad?<br><br>RUSS: Oh!

Good boy, Aspen.<br><br>What the hell is that?<br><br>Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.<br><br>I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen<br>when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,<br><br>when his fucking mother's here<br>to pick him up.<br><br>I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.<br><br>I've disrupted fatherhood.<br>It's visionary technology.<br><br>- Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.<br>-(BEEPING)<br><br>Aspen, remember to take your medication.<br><br>Hey. Just remember,<br>Russ only has two board seats.<br><br>So, as long as we vote together,<br>we can carry every vote.<br><br>Yeah, I'm familiar<br>with the rules of a board meeting.<br><br>MONICA: Okay.<br><br>Okay, so, 409A valuation report<br>and new ESOPs.<br><br>Is there a motion to approve?<br><br>Great, it's unanimous. Approved.<br><br>Now we need to clear the equity packages<br>we're offering to a couple prospective hires,<br><br>- Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.<br>-(GROANS)<br><br>ERLICH: Fucking cyborg.<br><br>Oh, um, Patakian is actually<br>a solid engineer.<br><br>We'd be foolish not to hire him.<br><br>He's really good. So, all in favor'?<br><br>Sounds like a good pick-up.<br><br>MONICA: Okay, four-to-one approved.<br><br>All right, is there anything else<br>we need to covet?<br><br>Yeah, I think we need to talk about<br>getting some schwag.<br><br>What?<br><br>- Schwag!<br>-"Sha-waga"?<br><br>Schwag I<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Schwag.<br><br>- Swag?<br>- RUSS: Schwag!<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Schwag.<br><br>I actually don't know...<br><br>I think we need to build on the success<br>of our outdoor media campaign.<br><br>I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,<br>puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.<br><br>Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.<br>That's like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?<br><br>I mean, first billboards, now this?<br><br>I... As it is,<br>we're barely going to make it to January.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>What?<br><br>I think it's a really solid idea.<br>I think we'd be foolish not to do it.<br><br>Cool. So, three-to-Mo in favor. Schwag!<br><br>I'll set you guys up with my marketing<br>company. We'll give you a killer rate.<br><br>Question, who likes margaritas?<br><br>Answer' everybody!<br><br>Babe, go out back,<br>grab some limes from the tree, all right?<br><br>Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.<br><br>(SINGING) We gonna get our schwag on!<br><br>What the fuck are you doing?<br>You just cost us $30,000.<br><br>I thought<br>we agreed to present a unified front here.<br><br>Well, if Richard wants a unified front,<br><br>then maybe Richard<br>should do a better job at unifying it.<br><br>Why are you such a dick?<br><br>Why are you unable to listen to people<br>who know what they're talking about?<br><br>Speaking of Mexico,<br>I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,<br><br>but I got roped into buying these two tickets<br><br>to the Muir Woods preservation thing<br>tomorrow night.<br><br>Sean Parker's charity?

Am I right?<br><br>Total asshole parade.<br>Anyone want these stupid things?<br><br>Yeah, I'm down.<br><br>Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.<br><br>- But, Monica...<br>- No.<br><br>NASTIA: Okay.<br><br>Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.<br><br>(LAUGHING) She's honestly<br>so fucking stupid.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She doesn't even know<br>what I'm saying right now.<br><br>And until we get real office space,<br>I guess we could just put you right here.<br><br>And we could put Patakian here.<br><br>I hope you don't mind<br>sitting next to a cyborg.<br><br>Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?<br><br>Well, he is a coder.<br><br>Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough<br>to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...<br><br>You know, if it's cool, I'm going<br>to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.<br><br>I know I don't start till Monday, but I want<br>to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.<br><br>You're getting a new car?<br><br>Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.<br><br>-It's pretty dope.<br>- That sounds expensive.<br><br>- Guys?<br>- It is.<br><br>Richard has something<br>very important to tell you.<br><br>RICHARD: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,<br><br>I need to be able<br>to answer any questions that you might have<br><br>about Pied Piper's harassment policy<br>and workplace code of conduct.<br><br>Apparently, every company our size<br>has to have one of those.<br><br>So, essentially,<br>if you find the workplace hostile in any way,<br><br>you can submit a written complaint.<br>It will be completely anonymous.<br><br>Essentially, don't do or say anything<br>that might offend anyone.<br><br>Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Guys, um,<br><br>this is actually pretty serious.<br><br>I mean, we're all cool here,<br>but we know each other.<br><br>So, obviously,<br>when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,<br><br>or he describes me as AIDS Lady,<br><br>or Gilfoyle refers to me<br>as effeminate k.d. lang,<br><br>I know this is a joke among friends.<br><br>- It's not a joke.<br>- We're not friends.<br><br>(CHUCKLING) See, it's hilarious.<br><br>But, um, as we grow,<br><br>we're going to be adding a lot of new people<br>to this company and to this office,<br><br>and some of them might not be<br>as amused as I am by such strong language.<br><br>Lawsuits happen. So, questions?<br><br>- Oh, uh, I have a question.<br>- JARED: Mmm-hmm.<br><br>My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- I'm sorry, her name is...<br>- Cunty.<br><br>And I was hoping I could call her Cunty<br>while I'm here.<br><br>Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,<br><br>and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"<br><br>then it's like, I'm not going<br>to want to have Cunty over at all,<br><br>which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<br><br>Yeah. Um, it does not...<br><br>As a woman.<br><br>Okay, I'm going to have<br>to get back to you on that one.<br><br>Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen<br><br>-so we can...<br>- Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>All right, I'm going to go<br>clean out my shit box.<br><br>Nice bag.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, look, D&amp;G. It's like<br>Dinesh &amp; Gilfoyle. So, yeah.<br><br>Okay, that was the third reference<br>she's made to how much money she's making.<br><br>GILFOYLE: Mmm.<br><br>(KEYBOARD CLACKING)<br><br>That's a $3,500 bag.<br><br>How do you know? You have the same one?<br><br>No, I have the fucking Internet.<br><br>Hey, you don't think she's making<br>more money than us, do you?<br><br>No, we all have equalized pay, remember?<br><br>Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,<br>but not new hires.<br><br>It's the classic dilemma<br>where the founders make less.<br><br>We told Richard to get her<br>no matter what it took.<br><br>Even if she is making more cash than us,<br>which she isn't,<br><br>there's no way she has as much equity.<br><br>You don't know that.<br>And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.<br><br>I guess there's a reason for it.<br><br>It's so people don't get jealous<br>and throw a hissy fit.<br><br>I'm not jealous.

So, in effect, the policy worked.<br><br>Well, I... Can we not do any of it?<br><br>It just that they're getting really pissed<br>and it's really distracting.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- No more Cunty.<br>- Terrific.<br><br>- That's really good.<br>- Cunty's done.<br><br>Great. But you said it again,<br>but maybe that's the last time.<br><br>Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.<br><br>- Yeah' that's fine.<br>- That's for good.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, because in my head,<br><br>I change the meaning from "Other Jared"<br>to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.<br><br>ERLICH: If I have to, I'm going to keep<br>my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!<br><br>It doesn't take an IQ-9<br>to know they should remain alphabetized.<br><br>I want to watch a specific episode.<br>And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!<br><br>(SIGHS)<br><br>Hey, um, Erlich,<br>I just want to say this is your house<br><br>and you've been really cool<br>letting us stay here for all this time,<br><br>and as soon as we get our office space,<br>we'll be out of your way.<br><br>And how soon is that going to be?<br><br>Soon.<br><br>And look, I realize it's not fair<br>that I bring someone into your house<br><br>that you don't want here,<br><br>so I will call the cyborg<br>and I will rescind the offer.<br><br>You know, Richard, I've been thinking,<br>the cyborg is a solid coder.<br><br>You should hire him.<br><br>It's fine, I'll get someone else.<br><br>Don't be stupid, Richard.<br><br>You need a full working beta up<br>in the next few months. Just hire the guy.<br><br>I'm not being stupid, okay?<br>I'm not going to hire him.<br><br>And frankly, I'm not going to let you<br>bully me into doing it.<br><br>Would you look at yourself?<br>You're still not fucking listening to me.<br><br>No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.<br><br>If you want to respect me,<br>then just hire the piece of shit.<br><br>Don't act like a moron.<br><br>You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass<br>acting like a fucking moron.<br><br>You don't get to tell me<br>how I respect you, okay?<br><br>I can respect you however the fuck I want.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I'm respecting you.<br><br>(CLEARS THROAT)<br><br>Jared, hey, it's, uh,<br>Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.<br><br>Yeah, bad news.

Fucking cyborg.<br><br>DINESH: Richard! You need to come see this.<br><br>What event could this possibly be used at?<br><br>Are you happy?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>They used the old logo.<br><br>Do you smell something burning?<br><br>God damn it!
